    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Brookhaven is a town located in Suffolk County, near the center of Long Island. The land was, and is, inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Indigenous people, largely the Setaukett/Setalcott and Unkechaug tribes. In 1640 English settled in the area, and subsequently purchased land from the Setalcott tribe in 1655. The names Brookhaven and Setuakett were used interchangeably until the 19th Century in reference to this township. Indigeneity, though, is not marked in Brookhaven merely through naming conventions or its historical past. Brookhaven remains the site of the Poospatuck Reservation, which has been state, but not federally recognized.</p>  </bioghist>
