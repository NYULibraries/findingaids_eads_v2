<p>The Brooklyn location scouting photographs collection contains photographs of mostly Brooklyn locations taken by location scouts for film and television projects from the 1980s to 2011. Photographs are taped into folder dossiers based on location and depict apartments, houses, public housing, hospitals, stores, restaurants, bars, diners, warehouses, churches, schools, subway stations, catering halls, funeral parlors, delapidated buildings, stores, bowling alleys, industrial laundries, and streets in neighborhoods across Brooklyn. Series 45 includes locations in other New York City boroughs. </p><p>The collection represents production scouting for the films <emph>Scent of a Woman</emph>n (1992), <emph>War of the Worlds</emph> (2005), <emph>American Gangster</emph> (2007), <emph>Doubt</emph> (2008), <emph>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</emph> (2011), among others.</p><p>Location scouts' folder titles often include "INT" or "EXT." This indicates when only the interior or exterior of the location was photographed. This was used inconsistently, so not all of the folders have this information.</p><p>Folders were often titled with what they would be used for in the context of the movie. For example, locations scouted for <emph>The Cowboy Way</emph> (1994) were labelled "Derelict Hotel" even if the building scouted was not a hotel or former hotel. This information has been left in the titles of the folder in this finding aid.</p><p>When known, further information about the movie a location was scouted for or how the location was categorized can be found in the Scope and Contents note under the individual folder.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Location scouting is a part of the pre-production process of making a film or television show and location scouts generally work under the Location Management team. Once the director or producer decides the type of setting they would like for scenes of a movie or TV episode, a location scout will go out to take photographs of places that fit the request or will source a location from their existing database of location photographs. In addition to the images, location scouts collect information on the location, such as owners' contact information, rental prices, limitations of the location, and anything else that might be useful for a director or producer when reviewing the photographs.</p><p>Filming on location in New York City became more appealing for the film and television industry after Mayor John Lindsay signed Executive Order 10 in 1966, forming the Mayor's Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting. The popularity of filming in real New York locations instead of on a set created the need for a Locations Department.</p><p>At the time the photographs in this collection were taken, location scouts created physical dossiers, manila folders taped together to create pages on which the photographs were taped. To show panoramic views, multiple photographs were taken and taped together to create an uninterrupted image. These dossiers were then presented to the Location Manager, the Production Designer, and finally to the Director. </p><p>In the late 1990s, a group of New York-based Locations Department workers obtained a storage space in Bayonne, New Jersey where scouting photographs could be donated at the end of a shoot and used by others starting a new project. Part of the collection was moved to a smaller storage space in Bethpage, Long Island in 2010 because digital photography and digital platforms for sharing and storing files was becoming more common. Now, location scout photography is digital and managed and shared digitally. </p>  </bioghist>

<p>At the time of the original accession in 2011, The New-York Historical Society and the Brooklyn Historical Society decided to break up the collection according to each institution's collecting scope. As a result, parts of the collection relating to Brooklyn are at the Center for Brooklyn History and parts relating to Manhattan and other boroughs are at The New York Historical.</p>  </appraisal>
