<p>Middle Island, New York is a hamlet within the Town of Brookhaven, located in Suffolk County, Long Island. Its history dates to 1766 when the first Presbyterian church was built in the area and the village of Middle Island developed around it. Middle Island's name derives from its distinction of being located approximately halfway between the Long Island Sound to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south.</p>  </bioghist>

On the page before the page titled "A" is a list of names and corresponding dollar amounts, possibly indicating the settlement amounts  for various cases.The notes do not clearly indicate whether the trials documented were criminal or civil trials.
