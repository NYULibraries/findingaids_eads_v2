    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Arts Council was founded by Charlene Victor in 1966 as the Brooklyn Arts and Cultural Association (BACA). The program worked to facilitate collaborations between Brooklyn's large cultural heritage institutions, such as the Brooklyn Museum and the Brooklyn Academy of Music, with local artists, musicians, and galleries. BACA worked to secure grants for artists and programs with a focus on Brooklyn neighborhoods typically underserved by cultural heritage programming. In 1986 BACA formally changed its name to Brooklyn Arts Council (BAC).</p><p>In 1988, BAC received a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA) as part of an effort to place folk arts programs in counties across New York state to do field research, create documentation, produce programming, and provide assistance to other organizations interested in developing programs. In addition to Brooklyn, programs were started in Buffalo, Corning, and Binghamton. NYSCA provided funding and assisted with developing guidelines, hiring, and site visits. BAC employee Kathleen Condon was awarded an additional grant to receive a salary as the program's first Folklorist. </p><p>Following BAC's model, Folk Arts prioritized neighborhoods typically overlooked for cultural heritage programming, and communities which often lacked venues to stage events. Condon solved this by developing a relationship with the Brooklyn Public Library to use library branches as performance spaces. Early events included Alvin Forteau and the Caribbean Dancers (Trinidadian dancing and drumming), Lillian Habib (Lebanese cooking), Jamila and Mahmood Masumi and Nafas Gul Muradi (Afghan rug weaving and design), and Doris Jensen (Norwegian rosemaler). Condon oversaw all marketing and outreach, often relying on the host libraries to send out press releases and hiring community members to hand out flyers.</p><p>BAC had to reapply every year for the Folklorist salary grant. The position was part time, and after Condon's 1989 departure the position was held by a series of early career professionals and graduate students. Events continued under the Folk Arts series and Welcome Back to Brooklyn Storytelling tent, but documentation was not consistent. The first full time Folklorist, Dr. Kay Turner, was hired in 2000. She approached the role as a way to work on "large frame ideas that looked at the importance of traditions within the context of things that were meaningful to Brooklyn." </p><p>Dr. Turner took an artist-first approach, often co-creating programs with artists and staging them at larger venues to attract a more general audience. Additional sponsorship allowed Folk Arts to produce multi week and annual programs, with expanded promotional reach. Highlights include <emph render="italic">Harborlore: Where the River Meets the Sea in Brooklyn's Folk Imagination</emph>, a series of 12 free dance, music and storytelling events exploring the role of water in Brooklyn's immigrant and diaspora communities; <emph render="italic">Folk Feet: Celebrating Traditional Dance in Brooklyn</emph>, a multi year project to identify, document and present the range of traditional dance practices in Brooklyn; and <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Maqam Arab Music Festival</emph>, a celebration of Arab music traditions in Brooklyn. Dr. Turner left Folk Arts in 2014 and was replaced by Christopher Mulé, who served as director until 2020, when BAC ended its affiliation with the Folk Arts program. </p><p>See series levels for a full history of each Folk Art program.</p>  </bioghist>

Kay Turner, Folk Arts Director at the Brooklyn Arts Council. BBR was a two year-long research, planning, and public presentation initiative in partnership with Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation. Beginning research in 2009 with major programming presented in 2010, BBR culminated in February 2011. Through field research, a series of public performances, exhibitions, panels and workshops, a scholarly conference, an oral history project, and other documentation, BBR celebrated the many ways Black performing artists, primarily those working in music, dance and spoken word, have contributed to the borough's significance as a center of Black culture in New York and the world.</p><p>BBR's yearlong programming was held at major venues and community sites throughout Brooklyn, with select programs in Manhattan. Many of BBR's concerts, panels and workshops examined how migration, immigration, and political movements galvanized these cultural expressions while drawing attention to the evolving interplay between Afro-Caribbean, southern African American, and African traditions. The project also sought to create a dialogue between young contemporary artists and leading artists of the 1960s, '70s and '80s. Black Brooklyn artists of different generations and styles shared, learned and performed together.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_1a7aaf580c078c3130cff8eaa001a84b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Program Files include information on the development and planning of <emph render="italic">Black Brooklyn Renaissance</emph>, including meeting notes, promotional materials, funding information, budgeting, and correspondence.

The Arabic word "maqam" refers to a group of musical notes and patterns of notes that form the building blocks of traditional Arab music. There are dozens of different maqamat, each of which creates its own characteristic sound and mood. BAC's Brooklyn Maqam included of a series of concerts, symposia, and workshops featuring nearly 100 New York-based musicians and groups representing musical traditions from Egypt, Yemen, Palestine, Iraq, Morocco, Syria and Lebanon. Musical programs included popular contemporary arrangements, folk traditions (both well-known and rare) and fusion pieces that integrate old and new styles. All events were open to the public free of charge. Brooklyn Arts Council staff involved in this project were Kay Turner, Folk Arts Director and Nicole Macotsis, Folk Arts Associate.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_8c5e3436baa9c7e1a1ed44829223c073"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Program Files include research materials, interviews, event documentation, publicity materials, documentation of funding efforts, and budgets for the project.

Artist files include biographies, notes, promotional materials, examples of work, and interview information. The Audiovisual sub-series includes cassettes with artist interviews.

Festival: Brooklyn Women in Traditional Performance</emph> was created and produced by Kay Turner, Folk Arts Director at the Brooklyn Arts Council. The festival, which was held from April-June 2012 consisted of six weeks of concerts, panels and workshops featuring music, dance, narrative, verbal arts, and ritual traditions. Events included lullabies, folk tales, wedding songs, and social dances.  The festival name comes from a Chinese proverb, "women hold up half the sky," and is used as a stepping off point for recognizing that despite the 50% statistic alluded to in the phrase, women's traditional performances are still often segregated and domesticated.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_e722da48f2cec9e7d12423e3d6172098"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Program Files include project contacts, fieldwork, media, notes, programming details, project history and scheduling.
