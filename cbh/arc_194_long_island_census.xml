<p>George Rogers Howell, M.A. (1833-1899) was born in Southampton, Long Island, N.Y., and graduated from Yale College in 1854. He then taught at Princeton Theological Seminary, from which he graduated in 1864. He worked as a minister in western New York until 1872, when he became the first librarian of the State Library of New York. He later served as the archivist of the State Library. Howell was also a prolific historian of New York State and published local histories of the early colony of New York, the capitol of Albany, the county of Schenectady, and the Long Island towns of Southampton, East Hampton, and Southold. Many of his historical works included detailed family genealogies as well.</p>    <list type="ordered">

<p>Minimally processed to the collection level. This finding aid was revised by Dee Bowers in 2025. Portions of the revised description were written by Cecilia Wright as part of a project to assess and improve access to archival collections in CBH's holdings that relate to Long Island, made possible thanks to the generosity of The Robert David Lion Gardiner Foundation.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists of handwritten transcriptions of data from the New York State censuses of 1855 and 1865 in two bound, handwritten volumes entitled "Ages of Families in Bridgehampton, Southampton, and East Hampton L.I. from the Census of 1855. Also of 1865." The volumes contain alphabetical indices (from B to H and from H to W, respectively) indicating the page numbers upon which certain family names appear. The notebooks list the names of families that resided in the Long Island towns of Bridgehampton, East Hampton, and Southampton, including the first names and ages of the members of each family at the time that the census was recorded. The notebooks do not list the addresses at which these families lived. It appears that this volume was transcribed by George R. Howell, who began this work on March 22, 1878.</p>  </scopecontent>
