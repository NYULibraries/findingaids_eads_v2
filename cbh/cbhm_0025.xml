    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>NURTUREart was founded in 1997 by former art dealer George J. Robinson as an organization dedicated to providing exhibition space for emerging artists. Early shows were staged at the United Nations, Presbyterian Hospital, and empty storefronts. NURTUREart also maintained an artists' slide registry, held in a filing cabinet in Robinson's Washington Heights apartment. Muse Fuse, a monthly networking event for artists on the registry, became a popular salon style event featuring guest speakers, hosted by board member Karen Marston in her studio for over ten seasons.  </p><p>In 2002, NURTUREart expanded programming to include the Emerging Curators Program, which facilitated introductions and collaborations between curators and artists to create mutually advantageous growth possibilities. In 2003, NURTUREart opened a dedicated gallery at 475 Keap Street in Williamsburg, which allowed for a full season of rotating exhibitions and a growing budget that provided stipends to participating artists and curators. The slide registry, expanding to over 1500 artists, was digitized and launched online.  </p><p>In 2005, board member and teaching artist Eliot Lable founded NURTUREarts' Education Outreach Program with 9th graders at the neighboring Juan Morel Campos Secondary School. The program quickly expanded to include hundreds of students from local schools, taught by artists and curators in residence. Students followed a curriculum focusing on art history, artmaking, curating, discussing art, and critiquing art. One of the most popular programs, Project Curate, guided students through the process of curating their own exhibits, from selecting artists to installing the work at the NURTUREart gallery. Popular Project Curate shows included Juxtacombo (2012), #Artistsbelike (2013), and (Im)Perfection (2019).  </p><p>In 2006, George Robinson retired, replaced by Karen Marston. The gallery also moved to a new space at 910 Grand Street in Williamsburg, then in 2011 to its final location at 56 Bogart Street in Bushwick. In addition to its regular exhibit season, NURUTREart held both general fundraising events and shows offsite featuring work donated by artists, the sales of which benefited the gallery, including the popular Nurturing the New (2005) and Nurturing the Edge (2006). The gallery also secured funding from individual donors, grants, and a portion of the gallery's sales.¹  </p><p>In 2019, NURTUREart closed citing "confluence of resource challenges and a shifting environment for non-profits." During its 22 years NURTUREart presented 17 full seasons of 6-8 exhibitions in addition to numerous curatorial projects at guest locations around New York City. Its online registry promoted the work of 2,100 emerging artists and curators. Its Education Outreach Program sent 161 artists and 11 curators to teach 1,170 public school students in four schools in Brooklyn. The education programs also provided exhibition opportunities for 80 artists in 35 exhibitions and events.² </p><p>1.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>NURTUREart records document the gallery's exhibitions, programs, and administrative activities from its founding in 1997 to its closure in 2019. The bulk of the collection is composed artist submissions, held in Series 1: Artists' Registry. Originally housed in binders and organized by artists' surnames, each file usually includes a resume, artist statement, and examples of artwork submitted by the artist to the registry. The submitted materials are mostly printed but occasionally appear on disks. Many submissions reference disks that were not included at the time of accession. Organizational histories reference an artists' slide registry, and although many files include slides, it's unclear if the slides were incorporated into these files or discarded after the slide registry digitization. The dates recorded for each file reflect the date of submission to the registry, not the dates of the artwork. </p><p>Sub-series 2.1: Artist materials were originally housed in binders organized by exhibit name and arranged chronologically. Materials in this sub-series include examples of artwork submitted for exhibits, inventories, promotional materials, and contracts. There is a significant overlap with materials in the following sub-series.  </p><p>Items in sub-series 2.2: Administrative and planning materials were not held in binders and have been arranged by the archivist. Items include press releases, promotional materials, agreements and contracts, photographs, slides, sales documents, correspondence, contact information, and artist submissions (slides, disks, prints). In addition to exhibits, this sub-series includes planning and administrative documents concerning panels and talks. Exhibits produced for Project Curate are also included.  Sub-series 2.3: Emerging Curators' Program exhibit proposals includes proposals that were not accepted. Paperwork for accepted proposals is held in sub-series 2.2. Additional media is held in box 72.  </p><p>Series 3: Administrative records holds materials created in the day-to-day management of the gallery and staff. Board minutes and meeting agendas date from 1998-2019 and are both handwritten and typed. Organizational documents include NURTUREart by-laws, certificate of incorporation, and financial statements. This series also houses documents concerning fundraising for the gallery through grants, donations, sales, and fundraising events. Marketing plans, press releases, and the gallery's strategic plan dating circa 2011 are also included.  </p><p>Series 4: Education includes materials created by students and NURTUREart staff as part of NURTUREarts' Education Outreach Program. Materials include teaching materials and notes, evaluations, student response sheets, student artwork, and documentation for Project Curate.  </p><p>With few exceptions, the artwork held in series 1 and 2 are copies reproduced on computer or photo paper. </p>  </scopecontent>
