    <head>Biographical </head>
<p>Bob Gore (Robert Gore, Jr.) is a professional photographer, active since the 1980s, who is known for his photographs documenting worship traditions throughout the U.S. and the Caribbean. Gore has also worked extensively in television broadcasting. He is President of Bob Gore Productions, a television production company, which broadcasts the weekly program from Jamaica and Trinidad, 'Caribbean International Network' in New York City. Prior to forming BGP, Gore held management positions with Group W Television (now CBS) in New York; WGBH-TV/FM in Boston; and WNYC-TV, where he held the position of station manager, and instituted the first daily offering of primetime Black programming on American broadcast television. </p><p>Gore is a longtime member of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church and serves as the church's official photographer. In 1984 he was New York State Campaign Manager for the Jesse Jackson for President Campaign. During the peak of the Chicago Freedom Movement, he served as treasurer of Chicago C.O.R.E. (Congress of Racial Equality); was a field staff volunteer with SCLC (Southern Christian Leadership Conference) headed by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr; and a field manager for VISTA (Volunteers in Service To America). Since 2006 he has been an advisor to Bethlehem Ministry, a non-sectarian organization supporting a school, a clinic and economic development programs in northeast Haiti. Robert Gore is the author of two books: We've come this far: the Abyssinian Baptist Church: a photographic journal, 2001; and Good news from Haiti: the work of Bethlehem Ministry, 2009.</p>  </bioghist>
