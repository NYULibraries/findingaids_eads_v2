They married on December 20, 1847, moved to Brooklyn circa 1850, and lived on Boerum Street between Broadway and Bushwick Avenue in Williamsburg. Lewis Nostrand Anderson was also the grandson of Lewis Pease Nostrand (1823-1900; born George Lewis Pease Nostrand), a businessman and resident of the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. </p><p>Lewis Nostrand Anderson graduated from Columbia College (now Columbia University) with an M.D. in 1895.
