    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>East Hampton is part of Suffolk County. The European settlement of the Town of East Hampton in Long Island was undertaken in 1648 by a group of English Puritan families who had initially migrated from England to the colonies of Connecticut and Massachusetts. The settlers purchased the town land, comprising 31,000 acres and belonging to the Montaukett Tribe, from the Connecticut and Massachusetts governors. In 1664, East Hampton became part of the province of New York, later to become New York State.</p>    <list type="ordered">
