    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Dodgers were a baseball team based in Brooklyn and founded in 1883. Between 1883 and 1931, the team that would become the Brooklyn Dodgers went through numerous monikers including the Bridegrooms, the Superbas, the Robins, and the Trolley Dodgers--purportedly coined for Brooklynites' ability to dodge the dangerous streetcars in Brooklyn. In 1913, the team moved to a new home field, Ebbets Field, and the next year hired Manager Wilbert Robinson (hence the name the Brooklyn Robins) who would become the winningest manager in the teams' history. After 18 years at the helm, Robinson retired as manager in 1931. The following year, in 1932, the team officially became the Brooklyn Dodgers and remained so until the end of 1957 season, when the team was moved to Los Angeles.</p>  </bioghist>
