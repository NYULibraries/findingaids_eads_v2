In 1902, he married Delia Monahan (1882-1952), an Irish immigrant. Together they had six children: Lillian, Mary, George, Helen, Louis, and Robert. Harent Aghamalian was a businessman, owning various properties, including one on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights. He also owned a parking garage in Manhattan near Roosevelt Island. He lived in Brooklyn throughout his life in the United States and was involved in multiple community organizations, including: the Brooklyn chapter of the Armenian General Benevolent Union, the Armenian Apostolic Church, and the Brooklyn Lodge of Elks No. 22.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>These family papers and photographs contain materials relating to the family history of the Aghamalian family. Most materials are from the first half of the 20th century, ranging from 1910-1950s. The folder titled 'Annotated Photos' contains photocopies of what appear to be pages from a photo album and their corresponding captions from the creator. These family photo albums of the Devereaux family, which are from the second half of the 20th century, range from the 1950s to the 1980s. The early 20th century materials specifically relate to the Aghamalian family and include photographs, obituaries, death certificates, immigration documents, correspondence, newspaper clippings and a newsletter, Hoosharar, from the Armenian General Benevolent Union. These materials especially relate to Harent Aghamalian's life and death. A few materials are written in Armenian script.</p>  </scopecontent>
