    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Home for Children was formed in 1927 with the merger of two longstanding Brooklyn childcare organizations, the Brooklyn Industrial School Association (and Home for Destitute Children) located in Prospect Heights and the Industrial School of Brooklyn, E.D. (Eastern District) located in Williamsburg. The Brooklyn Home for Children was located at the Industrial School of Brooklyn's building at 141 South 3rd Street in Williamsburg until 1941, when the institution moved to Queens.</p><p>The Brooklyn Industrial School Association was founded in 1854 and formally incorporated in 1857 to provide education, food, and shelter to orphaned, abandoned, and otherwise impoverished children in Brooklyn. It operated schools throughout Brooklyn that enrolled several hundred students per year, as well as the Home for Destitute Children, built in 1862 on Butler Street (now Sterling Place) near Flatbush Avenue in Prospect Heights. The Association's approach to its work was expressly religious in nature, with a strong emphasis placed on Christian moral principles. It was founded by female members of several Brooklyn churches, and thereafter its staff and Board of Managers was comprised entirely of women representing the different Christian denominations of Brooklyn.</p><p>The Industrial School Association of Brooklyn, E.D. was also founded in 1854.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Originally minimally processed to the collection level, this collection was reprocessed by Dee Bowers in October 2025. The current collection was formed by combining the former Brooklyn Industrial School Association and Home for Destitute Children Annual Reports collection (1985.101) and related material from the Brooklyn charitable organizations for children collection (1985.106). The Industrial School Association of Brooklyn, E.D. cornerstone materials had been added to 1985.101 in April 2023 after being removed from the Brooklyn schools collection.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists almost entirely of annual reports, which feature financial statements, summaries of activities and accomplishments for each year, lists of donations and donors, as well as the organizations' constitutions and by-laws. These reports generally do not feature the names or adoption records of any residents of the homes run by the organizations. A particular strength of the collection is its insight into society's attitudes regarding poverty during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, specifically the perceived relationship between poverty and moral depravity. There are also handwritten documents retrieved from the cornerstone of the Industrial Association of Brooklyn, E.D. building on South 3rd Street in Williamsburg. Among these documents is a list of the children resident at the home in 1877.</p>  </scopecontent>
