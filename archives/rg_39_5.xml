<p>This collection documents WNYU's history from 1949-1992, from its inception as an educational AM radio station to its acquisition of an FM frequency and emergence as innovative music programming. Administrative files, audio recordings of broadcasts, publications, and architectural drawings situate WNYU's growth and impact within NYU, New York City, and music history.</p><p>The administrative files in this collection date from 1949-1969 and include correspondence, minutes, legal documents, memoranda, and subject files that portray the efforts of WNYU's staff to build up an AM-FM radio station and maintain educational programming in the New York metropolitan area. Correspondence is predominantly between WNYU's staff and other constituent parts of the University, including Joseph Steinberg, the station's manager during the 1960s with University offices; the Inter-Colligiate Broadcasting System; Miller, Montgomery and Spanding concerning construction for WNYU facilities; and Larry J. Hollander, the faculty advisor to the WYNU staff, with Steinberg. Other correspondence relates to the broader media and metropolitan community, such as correspondence of the staff with fellow radio stations including the Columbia University station, concerning such topics as the election of 1964, Ray Nelson, and a Senator Claiborne Pell interview about youth legislation; letters from <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph> to Arnold Rosner, Director of Classical Music at WNYU; letters from the Police Department of New York City; and letters from United Press International. Also included are minutes of meetings of the WNYU Board of Directors, budget reports and operating expense estimates of WNYU members, log forms, schedules, applications, architectural drawings, certificates from Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, advertising brochures, programs, newsletters, printed promotional material, newspapers published from 1957-1973, and Static programs published from 1986-1988.</p><p>The audio recordings in this collection document WNYU's FM programming from 1973-1992, which highlighted music of various genres from the 1960s-1990s with an emphasis on punk and underground scenes. Shows included the New Afternoon Show, Crucial Chaos, Club 89, Music View, Rap This!, and Unheard, among others. Live performances and interviews with musicians and groups such as Sonic Youth, the Dead Kennedys, the Smashing Pumpkins, K.D. Lang, LL Cool J, Band of Susans, Butthole Surfers, Frank Zappa, and Sarah McLaughlin were showcased between DJ sets. The New Midnight Society provided a platform for NYU students and faculty to read their written works and showcase musical compositions. A few recordings in this collection also highlight NYU events and lecture series.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>WNYU was formed in 1949 on the University Heights campus of New York University by a group of engineers. Initially, the station only broadcast to the University Heights cafeteria. Well established by 1956, WNYU became a member of the Inter-Collegiate Broadcasting System (IBS). In 1955 the radio division of the Television, Motion Picture and Radio Department of the Communications Arts Group started a closed circuit station, WCAG, at the Washington Square Campus. In 1963 WNYU (Heights Station) and WCAG (Washington Square Station) merged into one closed circuit radio station through the use of a telephone cable. It was decided that WCAG would broadcast to both campuses during the day while WNYU would take over in the evenings. This continued until 1973, when NYU sold the University Heights campus. At that time the equipment was brought to Loeb Student Center on Washington Square. During the period of 1965-1973 the station worked to acquire an FM frequency. In 1965 NYU made an agreement with the United Nations to use their channel, "206." NYU submitted their first application to the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) in 1965. After three years the FCC decided that channel "206" should be shared by NYU and Fairleigh Dickinson University of New Jersey. WNYU broadcast from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. on weekdays.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The records of WNYU Radio Station were transferred to the New York University Archives when the radio station was moved from Gould Memorial Library at the University Heights campus to Loeb Student Center on Washington Square in June 1973. Further accretions to the collection have been added in the intervening years.</p><p>http://wnyu.org/, http://wnyustatic.tumblr.com/, https://orgsync.com/63665/chapter/, https://www.facebook.com/wnyuradio, and http://earshotwnyu.wordpress.com/wnyu-radio/ were selected by Aleksandr Gelfand in 2013-2014 as part of the RG 39: Student Organizations and Publications Web Archive using Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In June 2023, https://staticmag.org/ was added. The accession number associated with this website is 2023.034.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>This collection was processed by University Archives staff in 2000, and the finding aid was revised by Katie Senft in 2003. In December 2022, audiovisual accretions 14-045, 2016-031, and 15-025 were arranged and described by an archivist. Wherever possible, record titles were transcribed directly from labels provided by WNYU. Physically, items are stored together with others of the same format.</p><p>9 quarter inch audio reels were identified as moldy in December, 2022. These items are currently isolated from other items by housing them in polyethylene bags with desiccated boards and RH monitor strips. If a strip indicates an RH greater than 50%, contact the Preservation Department immediately. Do not open this packaging without contacting the Preservation Department.</p><p>In 2023, archived websites were added to the finding aid and administrative information was updated.</p>  </processinfo>

Shows included the New Afternoon Show, Crucial Chaos, Club 89, Music View, Rap This!, and Unheard, among others. Live performances and interviews with musicians and groups such as Sonic Youth, the Dead Kennedys, the Smashing Pumpkins, K.D. Lang, LL Cool J, Band of Susans, Butthole Surfers, Frank Zappa, and Sarah McLaughlin were showcased between DJ sets.
