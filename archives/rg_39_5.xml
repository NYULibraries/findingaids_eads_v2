Correspondence is predominantly between WNYU's staff and other constituent parts of the University, including Joseph Steinberg, the station's manager during the 1960s with University offices; the Inter-Colligiate Broadcasting System; Miller, Montgomery and Spanding concerning construction for WNYU facilities; and Larry J. Hollander, the faculty advisor to the WYNU staff, with Steinberg. Other correspondence relates to the broader media and metropolitan community, such as correspondence of the staff with fellow radio stations including the Columbia University station, concerning such topics as the election of 1964, Ray Nelson, and a Senator Claiborne Pell interview about youth legislation; letters from <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph> to Arnold Rosner, Director of Classical Music at WNYU; letters from the Police Department of New York City; and letters from United Press International.

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>WNYU was formed in 1949 on the University Heights campus of New York University by a group of engineers. Initially, the station only broadcast to the University Heights cafeteria. Well established by 1956, WNYU became a member of the Inter-Collegiate Broadcasting System (IBS). In 1955 the radio division of the Television, Motion Picture and Radio Department of the Communications Arts Group started a closed circuit station, WCAG, at the Washington Square Campus. In 1963 WNYU (Heights Station) and WCAG (Washington Square Station) merged into one closed circuit radio station through the use of a telephone cable. It was decided that WCAG would broadcast to both campuses during the day while WNYU would take over in the evenings. This continued until 1973, when NYU sold the University Heights campus. At that time the equipment was brought to Loeb Student Center on Washington Square. During the period of 1965-1973 the station worked to acquire an FM frequency. In 1965 NYU made an agreement with the United Nations to use their channel, "206." NYU submitted their first application to the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) in 1965. After three years the FCC decided that channel "206" should be shared by NYU and Fairleigh Dickinson University of New Jersey. WNYU broadcast from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. on weekdays.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The records of WNYU Radio Station were transferred to the New York University Archives when the radio station was moved from Gould Memorial Library at the University Heights campus to Loeb Student Center on Washington Square in June 1973. Further accretions to the collection have been added in the intervening years.</p><p>In May 2025, Sam Colburn, Archives Director of WNYU, transferred issues of the newsletter <emph render="italic">Static</emph>; the accession number associated with this transfer is 2025.023.</p><p>http://wnyu.org/, http://wnyustatic.tumblr.com/, https://orgsync.com/63665/chapter/, https://www.facebook.com/wnyuradio, and http://earshotwnyu.wordpress.com/wnyu-radio/ were selected by Aleksandr Gelfand in 2013-2014 as part of the RG 39: Student Organizations and Publications Web Archive using Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In June 2023, https://staticmag.org/ was added. The accession number associated with this website is 2023.034.</p>  </custodhist>

<p>Access to audiovisual materials in this collection is available through digitized access copies. Researchers may view an item's original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that have already been digitized are noted in the collection's finding aid and can be requested in our reading room.</p><p>Audiovisual materials that have not been preserved may not be available to researchers. Materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact NYU Special Collections (special.collections@nyu.edu, 212-998-2596) with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested.

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>This collection was processed by University Archives staff in 2000, and the finding aid was revised by Katie Senft in 2003. In December 2022, audiovisual accretions 14-045, 2016-031, and 15-025 were arranged and described by an archivist. Wherever possible, record titles were transcribed directly from labels provided by WNYU. Physically, items are stored together with others of the same format.</p><p>9 quarter inch audio reels were identified as moldy in December 2022. These items are currently isolated from other items by housing them in polyethylene bags with desiccated boards and RH monitor strips. If a strip indicates an RH greater than 50%, contact the Preservation Department immediately. Do not open this packaging without contacting the Preservation Department.</p><p>In 2023, archived websites were added to the finding aid and administrative information was updated.</p><p>In May 2025, issues of the newsletter <emph render="italic">Static</emph> were rehoused in an archival box and folder, intellectually integrated into the collection's existing arrangement structure, and physically rehoused in Shared University Archives 156 Folder 7.</p>  </processinfo>
