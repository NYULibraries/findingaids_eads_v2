<p>In 2025, websites were selected for capture by the University Archivist. Google Drive PDFs were added separately to the web archives using both Archive-It and Webrecorder in an attempt to better capture the content. A DACS compliant finding aid was created and the archived websites were described in ArchivesSpace.</p>  </processinfo>
