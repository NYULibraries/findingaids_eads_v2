<p>This collection was created by NYU University Archives staff. Accretions have been received in 2019, 2021, 2023, 2023, 2024, and 2025 and have been documented by the following accessions: 20919.119, 2021.021, 2022.030, 2022.031, 2022.078, 2022.079, 2023.029, 2023.046, 2024.084. Weekly bulletins of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences from accession 2023.046 were treated as an administrative transfer to the New York University Archives from the Courant Institute in the summer of 2023 when the Courant Institute Library closed. An issue of the journal <emph render="italic">MYCRO</emph> was transferred by Katya Greenberg in January 2024 as accession 2024.008. In July 2025, Stephen Policoff transferred print issues of the <emph render="italic">West 4th Street Review</emph>; the accession number associated with this transfer is 2025.033.</p><p>Websites were selected by NYU University Archives staff through the use of Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. Websites were not accessioned prior to October 2018. Websites added to the web archives after October 2018 are associated with the following accession numbers: 2019.106, 2019.107, 2019.122, 2020.012, 2020.013, 2020.041, 2021.003, 2021.036, 2021.037, 2021.038, 2021.039, 2021.040, 2022.029, 2022.033, 2022.070, 2022.072, 2022.078, 2022.079, 2023.014, 2023.023, 2023.030, 2023.057, 2024.007, 2024.018, 2024.047, 2024.055, 2024.070, 2024.081, 2025.020, and 2025.027.</p><p>Materials found in series RG 39.12 Glee Club were transferred from the New York University Archives Photograph Collection (PHOTO 00001) in May 2024.

<p>Decisions regarding arrangement interventions for this collection prior to 2022 are unknown.
<lb/>
<lb/>
The majority of the collection was foldered previous to 2022, although many folders were overstuffed and needed to be separated into smaller groupings. File titles were edited to reflect the arrangement. Many of the original manuscript boxes were replaced with new, due to discoloration and acidic breakdown. Oversize material was unfolded and placed in appropriately sized folders and containers.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Decisions regarding the web archives prior to October 2018 are unknown. The web archives from 2018 to the present (as of this writing, June 2023) was maintained by Nicole Greenhouse. Maintenance of the collection consisted of rescoping due to missing captured content, redirects and content drift, missing embedded materials (such as videos or attached Google documents and pdfs), and other materials created by selected entities in this collection. Archived websites and their description were added to their respective record groups in August 2022. Additional updates are expected.</p><p>In September 2023, accretions from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences were rehoused in archival boxes (boxes 437-440) and intellectually incorporated into the collection's existing arrangement structure.</p><p>In January 2024, an accretion of the journal <emph render="italic">MYCRO</emph> was intellectually incorporated into the collection's existing arrangement structure.</p><p>In May 2024, one folder containing NYU Glee Club signs was transferred from the New York University Archives Photograph Collection (PHOTO 00001).

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This is an artificial collection of printed material and publications from over 500 different schools, divisions, and organizations within New York University dating from 1835 to 2025. The publications typically include newsletters, event calendars, bulletins, websites, and magazines. The promotional material and ephemera contains brochures, booklets, mailers, and pamphlets, as well as posters. Material in the collection was separated from their original NYU University Archives record groups and placed together for easier access. This is not necessarily a complete set of any of these publications and it is possible that the same titles and print material are also found within their original record groups. 
<lb/> 
<lb/>
Some materials in this collection contain racist, abilist, and sexist imagery and text. Both RG 21.32 and RG 39.30's titles were retained due to their historical context. Both RG 39.30's group name and publication title were created by an NYU Black student group.</p>  </scopecontent>

These fact sheets feature photos, infographics and statistical information about their prevalence over the last several years, and (nonfunctional) social media feeds which populate with topical content related to each mode of transportation. The home page warns that the Factbook is a work in progress and advises users to check back for updates, but the site has not received any major updates since at least 2014 when New York University web crawling of the site began.
