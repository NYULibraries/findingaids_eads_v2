    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In the summer of 1976, New York University Professor of Sociology Richard Sennett chaired a conference on the Humanities and Social Thought in Bellagio, Italy. Sennett and other participants developed the idea for a New York-based institute to foster intellectual discourse and cross-disciplinary communication while at the conference. In December 1976 New York University and Richard Sennett's Center for Humanistic Studies co-sponsored the conference "The Future of the Intellectual Community in New York", which was co-organized by Sennett, New York University President John Sawhill, and New York University Professor Ronald Florence (then Director of the New York Council for the Humanities). Based on the success of the conference, Sennett and President Sawhill co-hosted a series of informal dinners for writers, artists, and leaders in various fields. Participants discussed how to continue to redefine and strengthen intellectual life in New York City. The ideas that arose from the dinners provided the structure for the New York Institute for the Humanities (NYIH). Correspondence about these dinners, and the first proposals for a New York Institute for the Humanities, can be found in the Administrative Papers of President John Crittenden Sawhill (RG 3.0.8), Box 44.</p><p>In 1977 the New York Institute for the Humanities was established as a permanent activity of New York University by an act of the University's Board of Trustees. An advisory board was formed to help with the Institute's early development, while Sennett, <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph> editor Caroline Rand Herron, and New York University Humanities Professor Thomas Bender worked with administrative assistant Toni Greenberg on the Institute's day-to-day operations. Herron acted as a publications and communications consultant, creating a series of Institute lunches and public forums. Bender also contributed considerable time and organized the Institute's first Gallatin Lectures. In 1978, the Institute received significant funding from the Exxon Education Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, enabling expansion of its Fellowship and Lecture activities. In 1980 the Institute was independently incorporated and formed its own Board of Trustees; however, all daily administrative activities were handled by New York University, with the Institute's Board serving primarily in an advisory role.</p><p>From the time of the Institute's inception, the Fellowship program was the core of the New York Institute for the Humanities, embodying its mission to support the work of individual scholars and intellectuals in an environment which encouraged interaction. About half of the early Fellows were academics from New York-area universities, while the rest were artists, writers, journalists, and public officials. In the early years, fellows generally met once or twice a month for informal seminars. As the Institute grew, Sennett worked with Aryeh Neier and Bender to create a more defined program in which Fellows--elected to either one-year or five-year fellowships--formed interdisciplinary seminars around topics of interest and participated in weekly Fellows Lunches. Most Fellows were unpaid, although some received office space or clerical support. Fellows were responsible for the Institute's internal operations, which were overseen by the Director and three committees: an Executive Committee, a Program Committee, and a Fellowship Selection Committee. </p><p>The Program Committee was particularly active during the Institute's first five years. The Institute hosted public lecture series and conferences, most notably the James Lecture Series and the Gallatin Lecture Series. In a concerted move to counter American isolationist tendencies at the time, the James Lectures brought primarily European intellectuals to the Institute. The Gallatin Lecture Series was created shortly thereafter to provide an audience for American humanists. The period of 1979-1983 was especially active, bringing such literary and intellectual figures as Michel Foucault, Italo Calvino, Czeslow Milosz, Jorge Luis Borges and Roland Barthes to speak publicly and to participate in seminars. In 1981 the Institute launched a Humanities Exchange Program for writers exiled from Latin American and Eastern European regimes. Many of the Institute's early lectures were published by Columbia University Press in <emph render="italic">Humanities in Review</emph> (1982), edited by David Rieff.</p><p>The core of the New York Institute for the Humanities program remains its weekly invitational Fellows Forums. The NYIH also sponsors public conferences, discussions, readings, lectures, and podcasts. In 2020, facing a financial crisis triggered by the pandemic, NYU ended its sponsorship of the NYIH. This decision went into effect in 2021. Under the guidance of a new board of directors, the NYIH has reorganized as a tax-exempt organization and formed a connection with the New York Public Library.  </p><p>

Starr speaks for about 30 minutes on the shift of conservative disdain of outright Communisim and Socialism to basic democratic liberalism as being seen as a threat to American ideals.

Grafton discusses Kircher in general terms, then focuses on how Kircher thought about history, tradition, and the past, particularly Kircher's thoughts on how the Egyptian tradition was recorded in hieroglyphs. Next, Paula Finland discusses Kircher as a global figure, focusing on his deep and intimate connections around the world maintained through correspondence.

Weschler explains the title by pointing out a common thread in the seemingly very different authors' works. Kapuscinski's The Emporer, on the surface was about an an anti-communist, Ethiopian regime being toppled, but was allegorical to the situation in Poland in the late 1970s. Oliver Sacks' Awakenings was about his patients with "locked in" syndrome, but could be compared to the result of liberation of nations, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, previously trapped under strict authoritarian rule.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><persname role="spk" source="naf">Sacks, Oliver, 1933-2015</persname><persname authfilenumber="(lccn)n82039639" role="spk" source="naf">Kapuściński, Ryszard</persname><persname role="spk" source="naf">Weschler, Lawrence</persname></controlaccess><c id="aspace_83f0054cfb17ec781d4978dcdfaf81bd" level="item"><did><unittitle>Original Recording</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/1018450</unitid><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_1e5718f9ed3c07a8eb3e42fcba421c36" label="Audio [31142062736684]" type="Box">72</container><container id="aspace_aa1d7ab40a7bd180f1d7b75cde58f5f8" parent="aspace_1e5718f9ed3c07a8eb3e42fcba421c36" type="audiocassette">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_374e8f0df3fb0b41962ece0df4840db7" level="item"><did><unittitle>Access Copies</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/1018451</unitid><container altrender="Card box, large" id="aspace_10c865f32b7fb81cbc6fff1ab8868691" label="Audio [31142062902252]" type="Box">Shared University Archives 110</container><container id="aspace_fd5b51e0356818b3df5e9c6e141f666f" parent="aspace_10c865f32b7fb81cbc6fff1ab8868691" type="CD">7:28, 7:29</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref2256" level="file"><did><unittitle>Discussing The New York Times Design Challenge for the World Trade Center Site: A Lecture by Herbert Muschamp</unittitle><unitid>cuid4114</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/6/archival_objects/672271</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 audiocassettes</extent><extent altrender="carrier">56 minutes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2002-09-27/2002-09-27">September 27, 2002</unitdate><physdesc><physfacet id="aspace_791df811c2f051e7b85d9485cf280d70" label="Physical Facet">The audio quality of this recording is less than ideal.

Princeton University professor Anthony Grafton hosts and leads the lectures. Grafton discusses Kircher in general terms, then focuses on how Kircher thought about history, tradition, and the past, particularly Kircher's thoughts on how the Egyptian tradition was recorded in hieroglyphs. Next, Paula Finland discusses Kircher as a global figure, focusing on his deep and intimate connections around the world maintained through correspondence. After Finland, Michael John Gorman discusses Kircher the "engineer and magician", the creater of magnificent machines. Finally, David Wilson "channels" Kircher to close things out.</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_ec760278fa9a0cb5b218cfddf491b6c1"><head>General</head><p>This tape is a duplicate of the first part of the material found in ref2253.

Intellectual goals stated in a letter of invitation were to better "understand how the productive processes of modern society are changing in ways not anticipated in past social theory" and to "expand the meaning of the term 'production' itself, so that it appears as a cultural, psychological, and epistemological category as well as a category in political economy." The final desired outcome of the conference was to set up an ongoing working group to pursue whatever develops during the sessions.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_91fa194cb4a602218fd4f0f0f938bd0e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Session 1: "The Production of Meaning" lead by Anthony Giddens and Bernard Williams.

This recording is on the A-Side of a tape which also contains Nicolas Wahl's discussion on France under Francois Mitterand (ref3244). The tape itself is IDed as ref2344.

The written labels for both sides are in the same hand and it is likely that the two events on the tape took place in relatively close succession of each other. While the year is not listed, the label says Wahl's lecture was recorded on October 22. George Konrad's tenure as an NYIH Fellow ended in April 1984, when he departed for his native Hungary, by way of Vienna, where he accepted the Herder Prize for Literature. The tape itself is a TDK, Normal Bias 120 us EQ D90 audiocassette that was probably manufactured between 1982 and 1984.

The premise of this two day conference is the complicated relationship between writer and censor and between writing and censorship. This involves discussion on how the two are not necessarily diametrically opposed. Questions of complicity between the two are explored, looking at how the writer may serve as his own censor, creating a grey area between the act of expression and the act of repression. Rather than formal presentations, each session was started by one or two people "put some ideas on the table" and then a general discussion among the participants. </p><p>The conference comprised three sessions; an evening session on February 1, 1980 and then morning and afternoon sessions the following day. Session 1 (evening, 2/1/80) was lead by Bob Silvers Aryeh Neier discussing the act of censoring, itself. Session 2 (morning, 2/2/80) was lead by Arthur Miller and Dick Sennet, discussing cultural censorship. Miller focused on cultural censorship in China, while Sennet lead the discussion toward "etherial cultural censorship." Session 3 (afternoon, 2/2/80) was lead by Joseph Brodsky and touched on the ambiguities involved in self-censorship involved in the very act of creating.</p><p>See names and subjects for a list of participants.</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_d3c0f6e8cc5c7de3d828962546ba123e"><head>General</head><p>The Censorship and Writing conference, comprising three sessions over two days, was recorded on 6 separate reels.
