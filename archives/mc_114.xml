    <abstract id="aspace_767a75dde3a03d664ac70860f641e433">Jonas M. Goldberg was an NYU student studying Latin during Fall 1917 and Spring 1918 semesters. Ernest G. Sihler (1853-1942) was a professor of classics and Latin at New York University from 1892 to 1923. The Jonas M. Goldberg Notebook (1917-1919) was initially used by Jonas M. Goldberg as an assignment notebook for his Latin 10 class during the Fall 1917 and Spring 1918 semesters at New York University. In 1919, the notebook was reused by Goldberg's Latin professor, Ernest G. Sihler, to write a manuscript titled "Emperor Julian and His Religion."</abstract>

<p>It was surmised that the second half of the notebook was written by Ernest G. Sihler, who taught Latin 10 in the Fall of 1917. This is confirmed at the bottom of an undated Goldberg page where the instructor wrote, "This last you latinzed quite successfully. EGS" This is the same handwriting from the notes in the second half of the notebook on "Emperor Julian and His Religion".</p>  </custodhist>
