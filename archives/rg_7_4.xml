    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Commencement and Special Events division was part of the Office of External Affairs and operated under the direction of the Vice President for External Affairs. The Commencement and Special Events department was responsible for the planning, organization, and overseeing of university events and commencement ceremonies. Other than convocation ceremonies, the department regularly organized university events such as anniversary celebrations, guest lectures, fundraising dinners, and site dedications. In 2002, the Office of External Affairs was replaced by the Office of University Relations and Public Affairs. The Office of University Events operates within this division and coordinates the many events formerly handled by the Commencement and Special Events department of the Office of External Affairs.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Decisions regarding the arrangement, description, and physical interventions taken on this collection prior to 2017 have not yet been recorded. In 2017, an accrual was incorporated into the collection in accordance with the existing arrangement scheme in Box 42. In 2018 an accrual was incorporated into the collection's existing Series I. and III. In 2019, materials were rehoused by Preservation and sent to offsite storage. Further accruals were received in 2021, 2022, 2024, and 2025 and incorporated into Series III.</p><p>In 2023, titles from the existing inventory were edited, adding dates, combining duplicate title listings of the same event, and moving the titles into chronological order as was originally stated in the arrangement note.</p><p>Unprocessed material had been foldered, but when necessary, overstuffed folders were divided into smaller groupings. Most of the manuscript boxes were found to be discolored and damaged. These were replaced with new boxes. All but two copies of print material were retained and the remaining were removed from the collection. The audio cassettes were numbered and labeled and listed appropriately within the inventory.</p>  </processinfo>

<p>This collection contains planning files, publications, and ephemera generated by the Commencement and Special Events division of the Office of External Affairs, and the Office of University Events. Event planning files date from 1870 to 2019, documenting preparation for New York University events which includes lectures, faculty convocations, honorary degrees, NYU Presidential Inaugurations, and NYU's Sesquicentennial celebration (1980) activities. Published material in this collection includes programs and ephemera from 1956 to 1995 related to NYU events such as dedications, convocations, lectures, and building openings. These materials complement event files in Series I. Commencement files document the experience of attendees through ephemera, graduation rosters, speeches, audio recordings, event scripts, and planning notes for the Commencement ceremony itself and related events dating from 1834 to 2025. Files accumulated on prizes and awards in this collection typically contain correspondence and supporting documentation on financial awards distributed to individuals during Commencement week.

and audio recordings for New York University's Commencement, Baccalaureate, and related events dating from 1834 to 2019. Files typically contain programs, invitations, tickets, rosters, event schedules, and speaker lists. Event scripts, librettos, and instructions in this series provided guidance for those who presented and participated in the various ceremonies. Alternate plans for inclement weather and other scenarios are also in this series. This series also contains handwritten addresses from NYU's early Commencement ceremonies, and printed copies of many of addresses given by NYU Presidents, Deans, and guests over the years. Special Commencement edition issues of the NYU <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph> included copies of Commencement and Baccalaureate addresses, schedules, and rosters of graduating students. Planning correspondence, post-event analysis notes, and dressing instructions for student and faculty are also in this series. A small collection of audio recordings and collectible items related to Grad Alley are also in this series. Commencement ephemera for some of NYU's schools and divisions is also in this series including the Law School, Medical School, and Steinhardt School. General planning files from the 1970s and 1980s refer to specific tasks, including commencement stage and canopy design, and designs for new banners and logos for graduation
