    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The mission of the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation Department is to preserve, protect and thereby extend the usable life of the NYU Libraries' collections. The department pursues this objective in accordance with the mission and goals of the Libraries, and in conjunction with the University's research mission. </p><p>The Preservation Department is responsible for the following activities: commercial binding, conservation treatment, reformatting, disaster preparedness, staff and patron education, and a program to monitor climate control in the Library. In addition, department include programs for moving image and sound preservation, as well as digital conversion. The conservation treatments used in the conservation lab include rebinding, recasing, rebacking, boxing, deacidification, paper cleaning, washing and, mending, as well as other minor repair work in order to preserve collections for current and future scholars.  Conservation treatments preserve the physical object through professionally accepted treatments that prolong the life of the materials. </p><p>Reformatting techniques are used for books and archive materials that cannot be physically repaired because the paper is too brittle to sustain conservation treatment. These techniques include preservation microfilming and preservation photocopying. In addition, special grant-funded preservation projects are conducted on an ongoing basis within the department to preserve damaged and deteriorating non-book materials, such as, photographs, music scores and audio/visual materials. Moving image and sound preservation are designed to provide collections care, such as proper housing, and reformatting for these rapidly deteriorating collections. The department also administers digital conversion projects that include a preservation component. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains the records of the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation and Conservation Department from the period 1981-2020, including conservation documentation from the period 2004 through 2020.</p><p>The materials concern a variety of preservation and conservation initiatives, including specific grant projects, as well as work involving bindery operations, deacidification programs, preservation microfilming and photocopying projects, and preservation supplies.</p><p>Specific preservation projects encompass efforts related to map preservation, student newspapers, a preservation video entitled "Murder in the Stacks," acetate audio recordings, digitization projects, photograph preservation, music research collections, and conservation training.  These projects include coordinated programs with other institutions such as Columbia, Cornell and Syracuse Universities, as well as efforts to conserve materials held by NYU special repositories such as Tamiment Library, the Wagner Labor Archives, and Fales Library. A significant amount of material deals with the Research Libraries Group (RLG) Great Collections Microfilming Projects (GCMP).</p><p>The collection consists of correspondence, grant applications, annual reports, and meeting records, as well as records documenting the department's administrative activities, such as strategic planning documents and job descriptions. Funding documentation relates primarily to New York State aid, as well as National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) awards.  Conference materials cover New York State preservation meetings, and meetings of the Eleven Comprehensive Research Libraries. </p><p>In accordance with the American Institute for Conservation (AIC) code of ethics, conservation documentation is maintained in order to establish the condition and aid in the care of cultural property.  Conservation documentation relates to treatment of items in the NYU Bobst Special Collections (The Fales Library &amp; Special Collections; Tamiment Library &amp; Wagner Archives; University Archives), the Stephen Chan Library Collection (Institute of Fine Arts), the Ehrman Medical Archives, and the Courant Institute Library.</p><p>Conservation documentation consists of logbooks used to track the movement of collection materials in and out of the lab, as well as reports of examination and treatment of items.  Some treatment reports include images of the item before, during and after treatment. </p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Decisions concerning the arrangement, description, and physical interventions taken on this collection prior to 2024 have not been recorded.</p><p>In 2024, an accretion of administrative records was added to the collection as Boxes 7-8, and intellectually incorporated into the existing Series II and IV. New series were established for departmental administrative records (Series IX) and specific granting agencies not already documented in the collection were added to the collection (Series X and XI).</p><p>In 2025, materials were deaccessioned from the collection. Some box, folder, and series numbers were changed to reflect the removal of materials.</p><p>In November 2025, an optical disc with conservation treatment images of blueprints of Manhattan Bridge was forensically imaged, arranged, and inventoried. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Appraisal</head>
<p>In 2025, Laura McCann and Lili Abikoff reviewed the collection and made appraisal decisions. All files with private personal or financial information were removed from the collection, along with other materials deemed out of scope, including worksheets, forms, receipts, financial printouts, and notes from professional conferences or readings. Drafts and duplicates of paper records were removed, as were physical conservation records that duplicated electronic records. Records documenting preservation efforts related to the New-York Historical Society library were removed. Final versions of applications, reports, and other records were retained.</p>  </appraisal>
