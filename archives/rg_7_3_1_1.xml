    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p><emph render="italic">Sunrise Semester</emph> was a television series that aired from 1957 to 1982 on WCBS-TV in collaboration with New York University's College of Arts and Science. The series was an early example of distance learning in which NYU faculty members would present accredited courses in a wide range of academic subjects.</p><p><emph render="italic">Sunrise Semester</emph> was broadcast at 6:30am EST and offered two courses a semester, six days a week. Each course consisted of three half-hour lectures per week for approximately fifteen weeks. Repeat radio broadcasts of the entire series were aired at 7:30 pm EST on WNYU-FM (89.1 MHz), a radio station serving New York City.</p><p>Course requirements were at the discretion of the NYU professor giving the lecture, but generally included a term paper and final exam.  During the semester, students in the NYC metropolitan area could attend any of the optional six two-hour evening discussion groups or arrange individual meetings with the professors. Throughout the series, viewers could take courses for credit at NYU or transfer the credits to participating home institutions. In the height of its popularity, 200 academic institutions across the country offered <emph render="italic">Sunrise Semester</emph> courses for credit.</p><p>Beginning with "Comparative Literature from Stendhal to Hemingway" taught by Dr. Floyd Zulli in 1957, <emph render="italic">Sunrise Semester</emph> courses covered a wide variety of subjects including math, sciences, literature, writing, communications, politics, theology, and anthropology. In 1980, NYU attempted to revitalize the program and enlarge its audience, and began offering the ability to earn a Masters in Liberal Studies by taking <emph render="italic">Sunrise Semester</emph> courses. In 1981, NYU also introduced interdisciplinary courses into <emph render="italic">Sunrise Semester</emph>.  </p><p><emph render="italic">Sunrise Semester</emph> won four Emmys and two Ohio State Awards between 1958 and 1960, and its viewership continued to grow throughout the 1960s and 1970s. By 1972, the program aired on 85 CBS affiliates with an estimated number of viewers between 1.3 to 2 million. By 1980, it was the longest running educational program in the history of broadcasting. However, the program was terminated by CBS in 1982 due to declining viewership as well as academic and legal concerns.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Recordings of Sunrise Semester Programs (1958-1982) contain video, audio, and film recordings of NYU course lectures aired as <emph render="italic">Sunrise Semester</emph> on WCBS-TV. Some courses are represented in only a couple of recordings, while others have more complete runs. The majority of this collection consists of open reel video recordings that were used by CBS Broadcasting, Inc. The collection also includes open reel audio recordings, which were broadcast in evenings on WNYU, and a smaller number of 16mm films and U-matic recordings.</p><p>Early <emph render="italic">Sunrise Semester</emph> courses in this collection include "The Tragic Dramas of Greece and Rome" with Professor Lionel Casson (1958), "The Legacy of Greece and Rome" with Professor Richard Haywood (1958), and "Classic Literature" (1958), and a History course on the Middle East with Professor Henry Noss (circa 1959). These were largely captured on 16mm film.</p><p><emph render="italic">Sunrise Semester</emph> in the 1960s is represented through audio and video recordings from about a dozen courses. These courses include "Shakespeare: Complete Plays" with Professor Richard C. Harrier (1960), "Introduction to Ethics" with Professor Sidney Hook (1963), "The Age of Michelangelo" with Professor Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt (1965), "Have You Read..." with Professor Floyd Zulli (1966), and "Philosophical Analysis" with Professor Kai Nielsen (1966).</p><p>The 1970s were the height of <emph render="italic">Sunrise Semester</emph>'s popularity, and make up the bulk of this collection. These courses include "Classical Mythology in Literature, Art, and Music" with Professor Philip Mayerson (1971), "Communication, The Invisible Environment" with Professor Neil Postman (1977), "Discipline in the Classroom: Social and Emotional Problems" with Professor Lawrence Balter (1977), and "Drama in Education" with Professor Robert Landy (1979).</p><p>Finally, this collection includes many episodes from <emph render="italic">Sunrise Semester</emph>'s final courses in 1980, 1981, and 1982. These courses include "Learning to Write / Writing to Learn" with Professor John Mayher (1980), "Women and Men in a Changing Society" with Dr. Marilyn Young and Dr. Ellen Ross (1981), "Radio, Television, and the New Technology" with Professor Dr. L. Theresa Silverman (1981), and four 1982 courses with incomplete titles labeled "AL Labor," "Child," "EJ Seniors," and "TH Ethics."</p><p>Course titles are described in full wherever possible, whether derived from the audiovisual containers themselves or from course bulletins and administrative records in the University Archives. Some course codes could not be described in full at the time of processing, and are instead described exactly as they are written on the audiovisual containers (i.e. "EJ Seniors"). Some videos are labeled as either a "Standby" or "Air" copy, which are identical in content but were used for different purposes within the broadcasting studios. Episode numbers are listed in sequential order within each course, and may repeat across courses.</p><p>Six boxes containing open reel audio and video recordings could not be located at the time of processing this collection in June 2025. Consequently, some original recordings for the courses "Shakespeare: Complete Plays" with Professor Richard C. Harrier (1960) and "Peoples of Africa" with Assistant Professor Elliot P. Skinner (1960) cannot be served to researchers at this time.</p>  </scopecontent>
