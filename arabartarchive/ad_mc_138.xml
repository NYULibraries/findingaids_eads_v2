    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Hussain Sharif (b. 1961) is a Dubai-based pioneering Emirati artist who was central to the development of conceptual arts in the United Arab Emirates. Alongside Emirati artists Hassan Sharif, Mohamed Yousif, Najat Makki, and others, Sharif was a founding member of the UAE's first art association, the Emirates Fine Arts Society (EFAS) in Sharjah, which established important social infrastructure that continues to foster collaborative communities of emerging artists. Sharif has spent his artistic career reimagining and adapting established techniques to reflect and embody his knowledge of his environment, giving new life to industrial materials and refuse like metal wire, cardboard, and paper scraps. Sharif's prolific and varied production of caricatures, paintings, installations, collages, and multimedia art has been widely exhibited in the UAE and internationally.</p><p>Born in 1961 in Dubai, Hussain Sharif was inspired to pursue art by the creative atmosphere cultivated at home by his older brother, the late artist Hassan Sharif, who is widely regarded as a pioneer of conceptual and performance art in the UAE. His participation in state-sponsored Arab youth camp programs as a student helped Sharif hone his artistic talent by allowing him to exhibit his work alongside other young artists from neighboring Arab countries. During his travels, Sharif explored the art scenes developing throughout the Gulf countries and the broader Arab world and learned from their style and technique. While still a student in high school, Sharif began drawing caricatures and, between 1975 and 1988, published them daily or weekly in local newspapers such as <emph render="italic">Al Wahda</emph> and <emph render="italic">Al Fajr</emph> newspapers in Abu Dhabi, and <emph render="italic">Al Khaleej</emph> published in Sharjah. Through publishing his work, Sharif was introduced to the journalism industry and built personal relationships with well-established caricature artists like Ali Ferzat, Salah al-Leithy, and Naji al-Ali, among others, and exhibited alongside them in joint caricature exhibitions in the UAE. Sharif held his first solo exhibition in 1981 at the Sharjah Cultural Club where he displayed his original caricature drawings. In 1979, artist Mohamed Yousif returned to the Emirates after receiving a formal art education in Cairo and, energized by his experiences, brought together a group of 16 artists, among them Sharif, to realize their goal of establishing the first art association in the UAE. In 1980, the Emirates Fine Arts Society was founded in Sharjah, sponsored by the Ministry of Information and Culture. The Emirates Fine Arts Society held its first annual exhibition in 1980 which saw the participation of 17 artists, including Hussain Sharif. </p><p>Sharif's interest in theatre grew organically through his proximity to Mohamed Yousif's work with the Sharjah National Theatre and, in 1983, he received a government scholarship to attend the High Institute of Kuwait. Sharif continued participating in local exhibitions while studying in Kuwait and, influenced by his brother, exhibited his first installation piece at the 1983 -/+ (Minus/Plus) exhibition held at Al Ahli Club in Dubai. Four years after the Emirates Fine Arts Society was established, they published the first issue of their art journal, <emph render="italic">Al Tashkeel</emph>, spearheaded by Hassan Sharif. The journal was a collection of opinion pieces commenting on prevalent art-related discourse, translations of essays on Western art history and art theory, book reviews, and news of cultural events in the UAE and the Arab world. Members of the Emirates Fine Art Society would participate in each issue's production, with Sharif editing and designing numerous issues. In 1986, Sharif graduated with a degree in theatre design and began working at Sharjah TV, eventually serving as their head designer from 1988 to 1996. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Sharif was part of a core collective of five artists who regularly exhibited together. While the group was sometimes joined by transitory artists, the foundational participants, the brothers Hassan and Hussain Sharif, Abdullah Al Saadi, Mohamed Kazem, and Mohamed Ahmed Ibrahim, became known informally as "the Five," after the 2002 exhibition titled 5 UAE held at the Ludwig Forum For International Art in Aachen, Germany. </p><p>In 2007, Abdulraheem Sharif, the brother of Hassan and Hussain, transformed his family home and a nearby warehouse into the Flying House, a joint exhibition and studio space and a substitute for Hassan's Satwa home, as a meeting place for artists, writers, and intellectuals to exchange ideas. Abdulraheem, alongside his brothers, Mohamed Kazem, and Dutch artist Jos Clevers, invested in the Flying House to combat the idea that prevailed in the artists' youth – that there was no contemporary art in the UAE. The Flying House, named after a painting by Clevers, now serves as a studio, gallery space, and documentation center for the contemporary art movement in the UAE.</p><p>Hussain Sharif exhibited widely throughout his career, both locally and internationally. He participated in most Emirates Fine Arts Society exhibitions and those held in collaboration with the Ministry of Information and Culture, local clubs, cultural centers, and galleries. Sharif also participated in international biennials including the 7th Cairo Biennale in 1998, the Dhaka Biennale in 2002, and numerous international exhibitions such as in Russia, Holland, France, Egypt, and Germany. Sharif also received multiple awards for his work, including the first prize for sculpture at the 1997 Sharjah International Art Biennale and the first prize at the Emirates Art Foundation portrait exhibition in 1998. His work is held in multiple public and private collections, including the Barjeel Art Foundation and the Sharjah Art Museum in Sharjah, the ADCO Oil Company in Abu Dhabi, the Commercial Banks of Dubai, and the Sittard Art Center in the Netherlands.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Custodial History</head>
<p>The materials in the Hussain Sharif Sharif collection were created and/or collected by the artist from the 1980s through the 2000s and have remained under his custody. 
In October 2024, the collection was loaned to al Mawrid at NYU Abu Dhabi for archival processing and digitization. Upon completion of the work at al Mawrid, the collection was returned to the artist in December 2024.
Some sections of the collection were initially organized by the artist, which formed the basis for the detailed arrangement carried out by the team at al Mawrid.</p>  </custodhist>
  <arrangement id="aspace_84021a9e904dc8d9ee98ff4cbe8d3ede">
    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The collection is arranged in the following series: (I) Exhibition Materials (1980–2007); (II) Press Clippings; (III) Photographic Materials, and (IV) Other Items. Materials are subdivided into subseries by subject or type and arranged chronologically within each subseries.</p>  </arrangement>
  <processinfo id="aspace_ae3b36dbb8f72d97010654dcac565914">
    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Processed by the team at al Mawrid Arab Center for the Study of Art in 2024, including Ibrahim Mohamed Ali, Maysa Shaer, and Jonathan Burr, with assistance from Nora AlSuwaidi.</p><p>The organization of the materials is based on an initial arrangement created by Hussain Sharif, with some further arrangements by members of al Mawrid where needed. The exhibition materials, press clippings, and slides were arranged in a chronological order whenever the date was known. </p><p>Arab Art Archive finding aids are prepared in both English and Arabic. Researchers seeking to confirm the Arabic spelling of an artist's name are encouraged to consult the Arabic finding aid. In the English-language finding aids, transliterations of Arabic names are guided by al Mawrid policy to use the artist's preferred professional spelling whenever possible. Spellings are checked against artist websites or social media presence (when existent) as well as any available government documents such as a passport or ID. In the case when no such primary documents may be found, spellings are checked with the Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF) and Subject Headings (LCSH); academic sources such as Modern Art in the Arab World: Primary Documents; Getty Vocabularies / Union List of Artist Names; and in some cases Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World. Al Mawrid Arab Center for the Study of Art maintains an internal Name Standardization Reference List with notes about authoritative sources. </p><p>Rather than transliterate Arabic-language titles of documents for the purposes of the English-language finding aid, it was decided for consistency and ease to translate Arabic titles, as well as titles in other languages, into English. Translated titles and phrases are placed inside square brackets.</p>  </processinfo>

The majority of the photographic materials were taken by Hussain Sharif and feature his artworks and exhibitions. Additionally, there are a few prints from Hussain Sharif's travels to London, Berlin, and Moscow, along with slides taken by Hussain Sharif during his travel to India in 1980-1981. This series also includes slides showcasing gatherings and group portraits in both indoor and outdoor settings. </p><p>The series includes photographic prints of Al Khor in Dubai, also taken by Hussain Sharif in the 1980s and 1990s. These images were captured by the artist as inspirational scenes and as part of his exploration of the space and environment in which he lived. </p><p>The arrangement of the photographic prints and slides followed the original order established by the artist. Several prints were mounted on white paper and placed inside plastic folders. The slides were housed in small plastic boxes, which the artist labeled with handwritten titles or annotations, primarily in Arabic. The titles given to the slide groups in subseries III.D. reflect the artist's handwritten annotations. In cases where slide boxes lacked handwritten notes, descriptive titles were assigned based on the subjects featured in the slides.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_94260c6c4e26803633339815904150ee" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>III.A.
