    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Albert Eugene Gallatin, painter, art collector, author and museum founder, was born in 1881 in Villanova, Pennsylvania, to Albert H. and Louisa Ewing Gallatin.  His great-grandfather, Albert Gallatin, was Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents Jefferson and Madison.  A.E. Gallatin studied law at New York University, but did not pursue a legal career.  Instead, he traveled extensively, collecting art and publishing books and articles on abstract art for nearly 50 years.  Among his subjects were the artists Whistler, Picasso, and Aubrey Beardsley. </p><p>In 1927 Gallatin founded the Gallery of Living Art at New York University, the first museum devoted to abstract art in the United States.  The museum featured paintings by Paul John Marin, Charles Demuth, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, most of which were loaned from Gallatin's personal art collection.  The museum, called a "brave adventure" by the New York Times (December 18, 1927) when it opened, remained at New York University until 1943, when it was transferred to the Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p><p>A.E. Gallatin became an accomplished abstract painter whose works were exhibited in museums and galleries around the United States starting in 1935.  His paintings are part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.  He died in New York City at age 70 in 1952.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Related Materials</head>
<p>The New-York Historical Society Library holds a vast collection of materials related to A.E. Gallatin and his family, particularly his great-grandfather, Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents Jefferson and Madison. </p><p>See also the Papers of A.E. Gallatin, which are available on microfilm, as correspondents and subjects overlap between the two collections. Particularly noteworthy here is correspondence relating to Max Beerbohm which traces A.E. Gallatin's endeavors in publishing Sir Max Beerbohm: Bibliographical Notes in 1944. </p><p>In addition are the Motor-Car Touring Society of the City of New York Records, 1907-1919, of which A.E.Gallatin was president. These records include:  constitution and amendments; some minutes and correspondence; membership list; invitations to meetings, dinners, and runs (many to Tuxedo, N.Y.); menus, clippings, photographs, and printed yearbooks.</p><p>Finally, "A Checklist of the Writings of Albert Eugene Gallatin" was compiled by Alexander D. Wainwright and published in The Princeton Library Chronicle, vol. 14, no. 3 (spring 1953); a copy of this publication is held by the Historical Society . The Checklist catalogs 46 separate publications, 16 contributions to separate publications and 108 contributions to periodicals by A.E. Gallatin from 1897 to 1952 on such subjects as his own book and poster collections, and the painters James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) and Aubrey Beardsley (1872-1898).</p>  </relatedmaterial>
