<p>In 2020, project archivist Elise Winks surveyed the collection, flagged the volumes with unique identifiers, and did baseline description. In March 2022, the collection was more fully inventoried and processed to a minimal extent by archivist Larry Weimer.</p>  </processinfo>

<p>The collection is organized in three series:</p><p>Series I. World War I Service, 1917-1920</p><p>Series II. Member Lists and Related Documents, 1878-1932</p><p>Series III. Scrapbooks, 1880s-1946</p><p>Most of the scrapbooks and other volumes in the collection had no title and so were given a unique identifier (e.g., SN-1, SN-2) by the processing archivists as they were found on the shelves. These identifiers are intended only to facilitate reference and are not indicative of any overall numbering scheme found in the collection itself.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Veteran Corps of Artillery (more fully known as the Veterans Corps of Artillery, State of New York, or VCASNY) was formed in 1790 by veterans of the Continental Army after the Revolutionary War. It became an active militia and as such participated in the War of 1812. Subsequent to that war, a separate organization of veterans was formed, the Military Society of the War of 1812. The Corps and the Society (as the documents in the collection commonly refer to them) merged in 1848. </p><p>It appears that in 1848 and for some decades afterward neither organization was incorporated and their merger was more a practical one of administrative and membership convenience, as both organizations retained their identities and separate membership qualifications. In the 1890s, there appears to have begun an effort, credited to Asa Bird Gardiner, to revitalize the organization, and the fact that so much of the present collection originates in that timeframe can likely be attributed to that revitalization.</p><p>In 1892, the organization incorporated under the name Military Society of the War of 1812. Still, both the Corps and the Society retained separate identities, roles, and membership qualifications. Those separate identities have persisted down to the present, and may have intensified, as reflected in the separate websites of the Corps and the Society. The ambiguities are reflected in the collection as many documents, which date principally from the 1890s to about 1920, can include one or the other name, or both. A 2013 history of the organization, available at N-YHS, refers in its title to this relationship as "Veteran Corps of Artillery constituting the Military Society of the War of 1812."</p><p>(The above note was based largely on the content of the two organizations' websites: http://www.vcasny.org/ and https://www.militarysocietyofthewarof1812.com/.)</p>  </bioghist>

Overall, the scrapbooks trace the activities of the organization from the 1890s to about 1921, though there are some earlier and later documents. </p><p>The bulk of the scrapbooks include a mix of orders, notices, announcements, circulars, newspaper clippings, programs, dress regulations for inspection or events, etc. Orders in the scrapbooks were issued by Corps headquarters or by particular offices, such as the Office of the Secretary or Office of the Commissary. Many of these documents relate to the "annual mess dinner" of the organization (the dinner menus are in the books). The Corps participation in various ceremonial events are also well-represented, for example, at the dedication of the Saratoga Battle Monument, an Evacuation Day parade, and the inauguration of William Sulzer as New York governor.</p><p>Two of the scrapbooks primarily relate to governance of the organization and hold minutes of the meetings of the Council of Administration of the Corps and Society. One scrapbook, apparently compiled by member Howland Pell, holds many original photographs and other pictorial works. A small number of related loose items that likely either fell out of the scrapbooks or were too large for them are included in the series.</p></scopecontent><arrangement
