The bulk of them are membership applications to the Colonial Dames of America, which are in the form of oversize genealogy charts tracing the family history of applicants. Mixed into these by N-YHS at some point are some number of photostat copies of genealogies, deeds and other family papers received from another source at about the same time in 1953.

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The documents in the collection were donated in February-March 1953 by two sources, and were combined together by N-YHS at some point in time, but not cataloged. The collection remains unprocessed with the documents, all oversize, still rolled or folded. They were re-boxed together for storage in July 2022 with this summary finding aid and catalog record prepared then.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection is unprocessed and the following description is based on a cursory skim of the contents done in 2022. There are approximately 100 documents. The bulk of them are membership applications to the Colonial Dames of America. These applications are in the form of oversize genealogy charts tracing the family history of applicants with names Sturgis, Curtis, Ellsworth, Sloane, and Redway, just to name a very few. According to the accession record, these were compiled for the Colonial Dames by the donor, Florence Van Rensselaer. Mixed into these by N-YHS at some point are some number of photostat copies of genealogies, deeds and other family papers received from Mrs. Eliot James; aside from the format, these are identifiable through the stamped accession date of March 13, 1953.</p>  </scopecontent>
