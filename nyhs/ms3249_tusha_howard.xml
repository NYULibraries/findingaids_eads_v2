    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>In 1963, Tusha Howard's daughter Deirdre Wulf was expecting Tusha's first grandchild. Deirdre lived in New York City, so Tusha and a friend travelled from England to New York and spent nine months living and working in the city. Her letters home -- written to her husband Tom, her son Charles and his wife Vita, and her sons Nicky and John -- describe her transatlantic voyage on the S.S. United States, her impressions of New York City, her apartment on Carmine Street in Greenwich Village, her efforts to find a suitable job in New York, her daily activities, and her travels to other places on the East Coast, including Washington, D.C. and Cape Cod. She also comments on the push to end segregation in the United States and President John F. Kennedy's assassination.</p><p>Also included in the collection are 57 photographs (Kodachrome slides) taken by Tom Howard during his visit to New York in 1963 (Tom joined Tusha in New York in October 1963 after their granddaughter Laura was born). He photographed famous landmarks, including the New York downtown skyline, the Empire State Building, and the original Pennsylvania Station, as well as street scenes and the buildings where Tusha and Deirdre lived. The slides also include family photos, and there are two 8"x10" prints of a photograph of members of the Howard extended family.</p><p>Finally, the collection includes two typescript drafts of a biographical sketch of Tusha Howard written by her daughter Deirdre for inclusion in <title render="italic">America Proper: A First Visit of New York City, 1963</title>.</p>  </scopecontent>
