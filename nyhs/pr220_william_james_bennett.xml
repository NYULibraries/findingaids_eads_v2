    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>William James Bennett was born in England in ca. 1784, and was educated in painting, sculpture, and engraving at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. He was an active exhibitor of watercolors in London in the years between 1808 and 1825, and produced aquatint plates for many illustrated books. He immigrated to the United States in 1826, where his reputation as a watercolorist ensured his election the next year as associate member of the National Academy of Design. Bennett often exhibited at the National Academy, and from 1830 to 1840 he was named Keeper, a teaching and administrative post which allowed him to live in the NAD's building. </p><p>In addition to his skill with watercolors, Bennett was also a master of aquatint, and made prints after many of his own paintings. His first set of commissioned prints in New York, which were published as <title type="simple" render="italic">Megarey's Street Views in the City of New-York</title>; are all scenes of Manhattan which he rendered first in watercolor, then as aquatints. While many other painters and printers worked on bucolic landscape views which were increasingly popular with the public, Bennett often chose cityscapes or street scenes as his subject. These subjects proved to be popular as well; Bennett exhibited his work regularly in the United States, and was sought after as an engraver and illustrator. In 1843 and 1844 he engraved ten illustrations for the pages of the <title type="simple" render="italic">New Mirror</title>, a New York City literary publication issued weekly by George P. Morris and Nathaniel P. Willis. Bennett died in May of 1844. He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.</p><p>Source: Deak, Gloria Gilda, <title type="simple" render="italic">William James Bennett: Master of the Aquatint View</title> (New York: New York Public Library, 1988).</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The William James Bennett Print Collection spans the period from ca. 1826 to 1844 and contains 46 prints of 33 aquatint views engraved by Bennett, both black and white and hand-colored. This collection contains several prints of New York City scenes and views, as well as views of other cities in the southern United States and as far west as Michigan. Most of the prints were published either by Henry J. Megarey or Lewis P. Clover, both New York printers. The majority of Bennett's large American engravings are represented here, and many were engraved by Bennett after his own drawings. Others were engraved after drawings or paintings by John William Hill, Nicolino Calyo, and other, lesser-known, artists. The collection is arranged into two series: Views of New York City; and Views Outside New York City.</p>  </scopecontent>

The three views are "Broad Way from the Bowling Green," one of Bennett's first engravings made in America, "South St. from Maiden Lane," and "Fulton St. &amp; Market." These early views of New York show busy commerce and harbor scenes, as well as a thriving residential neighborhood at Bowling Green and lower Broadway.

From 1831 to 1842, Bennett issued nineteen folio engravings of views of American cities, some based on his own drawings, others based on sketches or paintings by other artists. Eleven of these views, considered to be some of the finest early American city views, are included in this collection.
