    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Ernest Hopf (1910-1999) was a German-American artist born in Slawentzitz [Sławięcice, Poland] while it was part of Germany. He emigrated to the United States by the early 1930s and settled in New York. He married Alice Lightner, the recipient of these letters, in 1935. Hopf was most well known for his screenprints. He worked as an artist for the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s. His work is held by the National Gallery of Art and other institutions. </p><p>Alice Lightner Hopf (1904-1988) was an American writer who wrote both young adult science fiction (as A.M. Lightner) and youth nature books (as Alice Hopf). She was born in Detroit, Michigan, graduated from Vassar College in 1927, and moved to New York, where she met and married Ernest Hopf. The couple had one son.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection of 54 letters documents the early relationship between German-American artist Ernest Hopf and American writer Alice Lightner. After they meet in New York, probably in 1931, Hopf writes to Lightner while she vacations in Maine and visits her parents in Tryon, North Carolina. His early letters, many illustrated with his drawings, describe his art projects, his loneliness in New York, his attempts to find steady work during the Great Depression, his daily life, his concerns about his mother's health, and his job on a steamboat on the Hudson River.</p><p>Later Hopf travels to Germany to visit his ailing mother and his family. He discusses his family, visits with friends and family, the countryside around his parents' home, and the political situation in Germany. He comments on the "German national revolution" and the rise of the Third Reich, the "Nazi movement," and Adolf Hitler. Hopf has difficulty purchasing a return ticket to the United States, and much of his correspondence from Germany is taken up with ticket prices and his sailing options. Ultimately Lightner purchases his return ticket to New York on the Hamburg-American Line. Hopf returns to New York in late August 1933, having spent four months in Europe.</p>  </scopecontent>
