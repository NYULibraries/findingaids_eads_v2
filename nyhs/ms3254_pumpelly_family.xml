<p>The Pumpelly family represented in this collection was mostly based in Owego, Tioga County, New York, though descendants also moved to other states including Pennsylvania and New Jersey.<lb/> 
•	Colonel Daniel Pixley (1741-1807), whose will is the oldest document in the collection, was born in 1741 in Stockbridge, MA and fought in the Revolutionary War. He moved to Owego, Tioga County, NY by around 1790, managing about 3000 acres of property there. He died and was buried in Owego.<lb/>
