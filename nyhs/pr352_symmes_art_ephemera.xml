Symmes, mostly from the 1990s-2019. Most of the material relates to modern and contemporary one-artist exhibitions, though two-artist and group exhibitions, including those with themed titles, are also represented.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes about 3,000 announcements, guides, brochures, checklists, artwork images, booklet catalogues, and posters from galleries, dealers and museums related to art exhibitions. These materials were either mailed to graphic arts curator Marilyn Symmes or obtained by her when visiting an exhibition. The bulk of the documents/exhibitions date from the 1990s to 2019, when Symmes was working at Cooper Hewitt in New York and later the Zimmerli at Rutgers. </p><p>Most of the collection contains documents related to modern and contemporary one-artist exhibitions. These exhibitions primarily included paintings, sculpture, video, photography, prints, drawings, and installations, with some architecture, design, and textiles. Many artists are represented by only one or two documents, while others include multiple documents. Both well-recognized names and less well known artists are found in the collection. The container list attempts to identify at the folder level those artists represented with more extensive or substantive content.  Two-artist and group exhibitions, including those with themed titles, are also in the collection. 
Overall, as Symmes described the content when donating the collection to N-YHS, "The collection presents in microcosm a significant record of modern and contemporary artists whose work was exhibited during this period [1991-2019] primarily in New York City. This collection provides some insight into subjects, issues, materials, styles explored by artists as presented in these exhibitions—thereby reflecting a significant sampling of cultural and social concerns during this time period, as well as commercial interests of the American dealers."</p><p>Most of the collection includes materials from New York City art galleries and museums, though institutions elsewhere in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in other countries are also represented. Among the many galleries represented in the collection are: Alexandre, DC Moore, David Findlay Jr., Deitch Projects, Gemini G.E.L., Grey Art Gallery at N.Y.U., Hirschl &amp; Adler, Gagosian, June Kelly, Mary Boone, Mary Ryan, Matthew Marks, Michael Werner, Marian Goodman, Marlborough, Michael Rosenfeld, Pace, Pace/Wildenstein, Peter Freeman, Sperone Westwater, Sonnabend, Susan Teller, UBU, and David Zwirner. Museums include, among others, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Whitney, Guggenheim, New Museum, Noguchi, Brooklyn, MassMOCA, Philadelphia, Cooper-Hewitt, Yale, and Zimmerli at Rutgers.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Marilyn F. Symmes, a curator of prints and drawings, received her B.A. in art history from Stanford University and her M.A. in art history and museum practice from the University of Michigan. She began her curatorial career in the 1970s at the Smith College Museum of Art, later moving to the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Toledo Museum of Art.</p><p>In 1991, Symmes moved to New York City where she was Curator in charge of the Department of Drawings and Prints at Cooper-Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum until 2002. Symmes worked for the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art as the New York Area Collector from 2003-2004, and then as an independent curator until 2006. In 2006, Symmes was named Director of the Morse Research Center for Graphic Arts and Curator of Prints and Drawings at the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University. She held these positions until her retirement in 2015. She continues to remain involved with the art world by doing free-lance curatorial projects.</p><p><emph render="italic">(The above note was based primarily on a biographical note provided by Marilyn Symmes to N-YHS curator Marilyn Kushner.)</emph></p>  </bioghist>

The term "catalogue" is used loosely here and refers to a broad range of textual forms intended to provide some level of substantive insight into the content of an exhibition. By the donor's count, there are approximately 2,300 items in this series. </p><p>The container list identifies some, though certainly not all or even most, of the artists represented in a particular folder of documents. Generally, artists were noted if there were several documents related to them or if the documents, even if only one was present, included substantive textual information, such as a checklist, description of artistic purpose, gallery layout, or biographical information. While acknowledging the subjective nature of the effort, an attempt was made to document within the container list where one could find brochure or booklet-type catalogues or other such documents concerning particular exhibitions. Researchers will no doubt find other useful documents within the folders, particularly high quality brochures emphasizing select artwork images or creatively designed gallery mailings, but not all artists and documents could be itemized in this finding aid within the constraints of processing resources.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_77817fae053b395f42f96a71d03eb8ad"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The series is arranged alphabetically by artist surname, retaining the order as presented by the collector/donor. Entries in the container list that refer to "Set 2" are items added to the collection in 2019 by Marilyn Symmes that needed to be boxed apart from the original 2016 accession because of volume. </p><p><emph render="italic">Oversize items:</emph> The series includes many oversize items. Those that were originally folded and are only slightly oversize were typically left folded and boxed. Larger pieces were also left folded if it appeared that their design was such that the opening of the piece was integral to interpreting it or appreciating it as an object. Although the items are not especially fragile, care should be taken in unfolding and refolding them; please request assistance from the reference librarian as needed. Several oversize items that were more in the nature of posters were removed from the folders, flattened, and stored separately; all such items are noted individually at the end of the alphabetical container list under the label "oversize."</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref7_hou" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aa-Al

By the donor's count, there are approximately 500 items in the series.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_084eda0219758cc320f49f762210c5b7"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The series is arranged in alphabetical order, by institution name. There was no original order to the documents in this series so the arrangement was determined by the processing archivist. A few oversize items were flattened and stored separately, and they are noted at the end of the container list. The entry in the container list that refers to "Set 2" holds the items received from Symmes in 2019 and that were boxed apart from the earlier 2016 accession.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref221_5pm" level="file"><did><unittitle>292 Gallery</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1994</unitdate><container id="aspace_151430b6df47da302854a371c5c2dfe9" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020356]" type="Offsite-Box">17</container><container id="aspace_178e6fab10bd560a9c0eb3f1426a239d" parent="aspace_151430b6df47da302854a371c5c2dfe9" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref223_hgs" level="file"><did><unittitle>A</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">2003-2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_80fcd6e36015bd7dd59af54afc1a54d3" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020356]" type="Offsite-Box">17</container><container id="aspace_e6e46d756130b102bcb62633c07471ab" parent="aspace_80fcd6e36015bd7dd59af54afc1a54d3" type="Folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4e8e7b80b04b7bbb04a41a0c8718658b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes material from multiple artists shows at the following museums and galleries: Alexandre Gallery, Aljira Center, American Academy of Arts and Letters, American Folk Art Museum, Anthony Grant, The Art Students League of New York, and Axa Gallery.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref225_e1b" level="file"><did><unittitle>B</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1995-2016</unitdate><container id="aspace_aef0aec47f047244935eb3b1d6c0a0ec" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020356]" type="Offsite-Box">17</container><container id="aspace_3cb8c8226a95d6deb4a1b15b32875fcc" parent="aspace_aef0aec47f047244935eb3b1d6c0a0ec" type="Folder">3</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_7aef939cc5083d2fdc78f55a976e2884"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes material from multiple artists shows at the following museums and galleries: The Bard Graduate Center, Beach Museum of Art at Kansas State University, The Berkeley Art Museum at University of California, Bernard Goldberg Fine Arts, Bernard Toale Gallery, Betty Cunningham Gallery, Betty Krulik Fine Art, Ltd, The Boston Athenaeum, The Brodsky Center, The Bronx Council on the Arts, and The Brooklyn Museum.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref227_0me" level="file"><did><unittitle>C-D</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">2000-2016</unitdate><container id="aspace_ad32fd5b253996b6c4a94ff84e099156" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020356]" type="Offsite-Box">17</container><container id="aspace_6f4215a86a67e8581ee881199f0e6963" parent="aspace_ad32fd5b253996b6c4a94ff84e099156" type="Folder">4</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ae13dcbe6d1299efcf607a3c472ca0ee"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes material from multiple artists shows at the following museums and galleries: Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University, Cencebaugh Contemporary Gallery, The Chelsea Art Museum, Cook Fine Art, Davison Art Center at Wesleyan University, DC Moore Gallery, Dominique Levy Gallery, Dorsky Gallery, and The Drawing Center.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref229_jwr" level="file"><did><unittitle>David Findlay Jr. Gallery</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">2006-2016</unitdate><container id="aspace_5fcb87d32f868bdca2be65f4c29c45e7" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020356]" type="Offsite-Box">17</container><container id="aspace_7489975477a12961c9830d42ca818eb6" parent="aspace_5fcb87d32f868bdca2be65f4c29c45e7" type="Folder">5</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b2426f22aa2981bcb9c2d54800c7a653"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes material from multiple artists shows at the David Findlay Jr. Gallery.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref231_98r" level="file"><did><unittitle>Deitch Projects</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">2002-2008</unitdate><container id="aspace_d7d1ee985c77a3abf2c3103f1c6dfa76" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020356]" type="Offsite-Box">17</container><container id="aspace_021c6cc38a8f56336fd355ae22c86652" parent="aspace_d7d1ee985c77a3abf2c3103f1c6dfa76" type="Folder">6</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ca30e711a49f2fd558ed6f31344e43b1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes material from multiple artists shows at Deitch Projects.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref233_801" level="file"><did><unittitle>E-F</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1992-2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_30e5b94843c72c23f6f05aafeb6485eb" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020356]" type="Offsite-Box">17</container><container id="aspace_460e9156b2c916093037318ca20cbd2b" parent="aspace_30e5b94843c72c23f6f05aafeb6485eb" type="Folder">7</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_bb3de6b438ade941f0b3464b23332e88"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes material from multiple artists shows at the following museums and galleries: EFA Gallery, ExitArt, Eyebeam, The Fabric Workshop and Museum, FiveMyles Gallery, F.I.T.
