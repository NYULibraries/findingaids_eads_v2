    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Belfast linen merchant Alexander Brown emigrated to the United States in 1800 and in 1818 founded Alex. Brown &amp; Sons to import and export commodities, including Irish linen and American tobacco and cotton. The firm later established offices in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. In 1810, Alexander's eldest son William returned to England and established the trading firm William Brown &amp; Co. in Liverpool. This became Brown Shipley &amp; Co. in 1839 and relocated to London. It separated from Brown Brothers as a distinct business entity in 1918. The extending of credit and other banking-related opportunities that stemmed from international trade gradually became more profitable than the physical moving and sale of actual goods, and these solely financial endeavors became and remained the firm's focus. It originated travelers' letters of credits, later known as travelers checks, which allowed both individuals and corporations to access credit worldwide, through a network of international correspondent banks.</p><p>As financing opportunities and cash availability were diminished by the Depression, in 1931 Brown Brothers merged with the Harriman interests, to become Brown Brothers Harriman. The Harriman ventures included widespread investment and other financial holdings organized from Edward R. Harriman's vast fortunes, gained initially through successive mergers into what became the Union Pacific Railroad, and later by extensive and prudent investment. </p><p>In 1964 John A. Kouwenhoven, professor of English at Barnard College and the author of <emph render="italic"> The Columbia Historical Portrait of New York</emph>, among other works, was hired by Brown Brothers Harriman to identify and amass records of historical value to the firm. His title was Director of the Historical Files, which were to serve, among other purposes, as the research materials for the writing of <emph render="italic">Partners in Banking</emph>, commissioned by Doubleday &amp; Co. publishers to celebrate the firm's 150th anniversary in 1968. Kouwenhoven was assisted by researcher Sarah B. Brown, a former history teacher at the Brearley School and wife of partner Thatcher M. Brown III; and by Patricia Hoban. Mr. and Mrs. Brown were both direct descendants of Brown Brothers founder, Alexander Brown. </p>  </bioghist>

They document many aspects of the founding, management, and evolution of Brown Brothers Harriman and its constituent preceding organizations including Brown Brothers &amp; Co., Brown Shipley &amp; Co., and W.A. Harriman &amp; Co., as well as biographical information about partners, staff members, and other relevant individuals. They also include records of all aspects of the preparation, publication, and publicity for <emph render="italic">Partners in Banking</emph>. Because the Files were specifically compiled as research for this book, they form a consciously chosen, or artificial, collection rather than a true archive of the companies' naturally occurring records over time. Material continued to be added to the Historical Files sporadically until 1975.</p><p>As well as documenting the company's history, the Files provide details about the business processes of financial firms over a period of 200 years, including changes in long-distance communications, financial instruments, image creation and distribution, and staffing decisions.</p><p>Because the Historical Files were compiled as an aid to research, they include significant repetition and overlap of materials. For example, Subseries D. Historical Files Director's Files, complements information on the firm's 150th anniversary celebrations also documented in the 1968 files of Subseries A. Chronological Files, and the "150th anniversary" and "Sesquicentennial" files in Subseries B. Subject Files. There is extensive and detailed cross-referencing of documents in Subseries I.A. Chronological, I.B. Subjects, and I.C. People, documented in the "cross-reference sheets" in each of those. </p><p>The photographic prints in this series include those reproduced in <emph render="italic">Partners in Banking</emph>, sometimes with their accompanying negatives. These provide information on sources, permissions, and the images' placement in the book's final layout. Many are not original to the collection but were sourced from other places for use in the book.</p><p>Included with the Records, and available for researchers' use in the Reading Room,  is an index to the Historical Files compiled by Kouwenhoven and  Brown, in the form of a six-drawer card catalog organized into two sections: one alphabetical and one chronological. Its level of detail and cross-referencing is greater than the container lists below and complements the word-searchable capabilities of this Finding Aid.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_c3db53c4ec0334038f212c4f344c13c8"><head>Historical Note</head><p>In compiling the Historical Files, Kouwenhoven and Brown consulted existing published and archival records, visited Brown ancestral properties and company facilities, and interviewed current and past Brown Brothers Harriman partners, managers, and employees. From these many sources they accessioned original material, photocopies, and transcripts to add to the Historical Files based on the information's usefulness to the research and writing of the company's history. Original material was not necessarily preferred over secondary versions.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_1fcf8ca629afa6dccb5d2ab294f714d6"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The Historical Files were arranged by Kouwenhoven in three series (Chronological Files, Subject Files, People Files), which form Subseries I.A., I.B., and I.C, respectively. These have been rehoused from their original storage in five three-drawer filing cabinets. Subseries I.D. Historical Files Director's Files contains materials found separately in the Records relating to the formation and running of the Historical Files, including making and answering research requests; and the preparation, publication, and promotion of <emph render="italic">Partners in Banking</emph>. </p><p>The series was originally housed in oversized cardboard folders containing items often in individual folders or envelopes that were heavily annotated on the outside. (Some samples are included at the end of Subseries I.D.) Information available only on the annotations has been photocopied onto acid-free paper and precedes the original item in the files. Users are advised to consult the card catalog in the repository for cross-references to these annotations, since this detailed, item-level information is not reflected in the container list. </p><p>Materials found elsewhere in the collection that were marked for inclusion in the Historical Files but were not yet filed there have been added as appropriate: a notebook of information about guests from Switzerland and the United Kingdom attending the Pacific Northwest 150th anniversary festivities is now included in the "1968" section of the Chronological files (Subseries I.A). Boston office forms, Brown Brothers &amp; Co. correspondence, Tax Department files, and co-partnership records have been added to the Subject files (Subseries I.B.). Clippings about the activities of partner and sometime State Department appointee Robert A. Lovett are now included in the Partners files (Subseries I.C.vi.)</p><p>The dates on folders denote the period for which the material would be relevant to the writing of <emph render="italic">Partners in Banking</emph>, not the date of the material's creation or receipt, which may have been decades or centuries later. For example, information on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1831 is filed under that date, even though the document itself is dated 1966. Original order has been retained within folders; some materials are now housed in separate oversized (OS) boxes of various sizes, noted in the container lists. Material in the OS boxes is listed here chronologically; there is variation in box numbers within that listing based on the various sizes of oversized materials.</p><p>Volumes 1-12 were originally foldered in the Historical Files; they have been removed and are described together at the end of their respective subseries. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2_1t2" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries A.

Subject Files or Subseries C. People Files, and photographic prints including those used in <emph render="italic">Partners in Business</emph>. The latter sometimes include photographic negatives, and information on sources, permissions, and placement in the book's final layout.</p><p>The files give an overview of the evolution of Brown Brothers from a commodities importation firm to a highly influential worldwide bank and investment house. Important events and topics include agent Joseph Shipley's negotiations with the Bank of England during the panic of 1837; bank actions during the panics of 1857 and 1907 and its contributions to the Gold Fund of 1914; funding actions in Nicaragua from 1911 on, and subsequent investigations of its political consequences; Brown Brothers' relationship and eventual merger with the Harriman interests; changes in partnership agreements and personnel; loans and bond issues; and the firm's interest in and promotion of its history through its anniversary celebrations at 100, 125, and 150 years.</p><p>Materials dating after the 1940s contain more information about the daily administration of the bank, including  photographs of current employees and production of the 1959 brochure "Personality of a Bank". Many materials from the mid-1950s appear to have been taken from the scrapbooks of Catherine Barrett (see Series VI. Scrapbooks and Collected Material). From 1964 to 1968 John Kouwenhoven was a Brown Brothers Harriman staff member. The files from that period, including information routinely routed to the Historical Files about the firm's  day-to-day operations, policy, and personnel changes, provide a look at business practices of this period. The files also document Kouwenhoven's activities in interviewing current and past employees and partners, and establishing procedures for his office.</p><p>The material in this subseries complements and often duplicates that in the other three subseries of Series I. For example, material on the 150th anniversary celebrations occurs here under "1968" and in the Subject files under both "Sesquicentennial" and "Sun Valley". </p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_cd99700a77a9798779982d4e0f7e11e8"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is arranged chronologically but, within this order, some materials are grouped by subject. These have been inserted at their beginning dates and the chronological order resumes at their completion. They include information on Brown Brothers &amp; Co.'s involvement in Nicaraguan financing, 1911-1929, which follows 1910-1914;  the 1914-1918 partner deliberations on separating the business of Brown Shipley &amp; Co. from that of Brown Brothers &amp; Co., which follows 1917; the merger of Brown Brothers &amp; Co. with W.A. Harriman (1928-1935), which follows 1931; the preparation and publication of the brochure "The Personality of a Bank", which follows 1959; funding of Community Research &amp; Development /Rouse Corporation /Columbia MD, which precedes the 1965 files; and the company's 150th anniversary, which follows the other 1968 files. </p><p>Duplication of materials is prevalent. For example, a set of Partners' letterbooks, 1851-1859, was photocopied from microfilm housed at the Liverpool Public Libraries. The 1851-1853 letters were also photocopied, individually foldered, and annotated by Kouwenhoven. These are now arranged by date and each letter is preceded by a photocopy of the annotations.</p><p>Bound volumes 1-6 are listed together at the end of the series, in chronological order.</p><p>Various oversize photographs found organized separately in the Records, but originally marked as belonging to the Chronological files, are included here.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Linen industry -- Northern Ireland -- History.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Investment banking</subject><subject source="lcsh">International finance</subject><subject source="lcsh">Financial crises -- United States.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Depressions -- 1907 -- United States.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Cotton trade</subject><genreform source="aat">Bills of exchange.</genreform><subject source="lcsh">Banks and banking -- Great Britain -- History.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Banks and banking -- United States -- History.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Banks and banking -- Maryland -- Baltimore.</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Baltimore (Md.) </geogname><geogname source="lcsh">Lower Manhattan (New York, N.Y.)</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">New Orleans (La.) </geogname><geogname source="lcsh">New York (N.Y.)</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">Nicaragua -- History -- 1838-1909.</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Securities industry -- United States -- History.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Shipping -- United States.</subject><geogname source="lcsh">United States -- Economic policy.</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">United States -- Relations -- Nicaragua.</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">Wall Street (New York, N.Y.)</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">United States -- History -- Civil War, 1861-1865.</geogname><persname source="naf">Roosa, Robert V.</persname><persname source="naf">Lovett,  Robert A.

They provide information on its offices, activities, and agents, including investment in the Collins steamship line and the deaths of Brown family members aboard <emph render="italic">Arctic</emph> in 1854; details of the 1931 merger with the Harriman interests; deeds, plans, and purchases of property at and around the firm's New York offices at 59 Wall Street; and financing during World Wars I and II. The co-partnership files give details of the additions to the firm's partners, and their loss through retirement or death, from 1915 to 1953. </p><p>Highlights include detailed examples of Brown Brothers &amp; Co.'s letters of credit, which provided access to funds for individuals and organizations internationally, including a list of London locations that would cash travelers checks with an accompanying note from John D. Rockefeller Jr.; W. Averell Harriman's unused $10,000 letter of credit while he was roving ambassador for President Franklin Roosevelt in 1942; and, from the Philadelphia office, a credit draft endorsed with withdrawals from Hawaii through South and East Asia to France and Italy on a 1928 world tour by a Brown Brothers customer. An indexed collection of letter abstracts and other communications received and sent by the Philadelphia office of Brown Brothers &amp; Co. provides a snapshot of bank operations nationally and internationally, including foreign exchange issues, in the period 1885-1904.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_9b8fcb17eac9cc4d938bed44141a47f6"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is arranged alphabetically by name of person, place, event, or other appropriate subject heading. </p><p>Placed before the alphabetical listing (which begins with "Alex. Brown &amp; Sons") is a group of Case History files, which were prepared for inclusion in <emph render="italic">Partners in Banking</emph>, but not eventually used in that format. Information from these proposed Case Histories on the merger of Bangor Aroostook Railroad with the Punta Alegre sugar manufacturing company, and Brown Brothers Harriman's role in the development of Columbia, MD, became instead extended captions describing photographs at the end of the book (pp. 206-208). Original order of these materials has been retained.</p><p>The organization of materials in the subseries is not always consistent, and is often duplicative. For example, information on overseas banks is grouped into Foreign Banks, but there are separate files for Banque de France and Norge Bank; information on Punta Alegre exists in both the Case Files and in alphabetical order; and materials pertaining to the firm's 150th anniversary celebrations are included under both "Sesquicentennial" and "Sun Valley", as well as in the "1968" materials in Subseries I.A. Chronological Files. Material originally filed under "Metropolitan Museum of Art" has been included in the folder "Crosby Brown Collection of Musical Instruments," because it is specifically on that subject. Consulting the card catalog to the collection available in the Reading Room, which provides item-level indexing, may be helpful in resolving these inconsistencies.</p><p>Materials within subject headings were originally in chronological order, and that has been retained in smaller files. In larger files, materials have been organized into types (e.g., clippings, correspondence, cross-reference sheets, images) for clearer identification, and then ordered chronologically.</p><p>Volumes 7-12, which were originally included in the Subject files, have been removed and are listed in chronological order at the end of the container list. </p><p>All information pertaining to Brown Brothers' Wall Street offices, which was originally out of order (including a chronology found together with some visual materials), is now included in the "Property" files. Correspondence between partner Thatcher Brown and Museum of the City of New York director Harding Scholle from the 1940s indicates that the original deeds to the Wall Street property from 1699 and 1708 are on permanent loan to the Museum, available at that time to be borrowed on request. </p><p>Various materials found elsewhere in the collection have been added to the Subject files as appropriate. Binders containing draft and final data printouts with information on attendees at the 1968 Sun Valley sesquicentennial gathering are now included in the "Sun Valley" materials as boxes 55-57. Their date order is not consistent because these materials are housed in different-sized boxes. </p><p>Records almost exclusively to do with co-partnership agreements had been culled from the firm's original records for inclusion in Thatcher Brown's 1950 book <emph render="italic">Brown Brothers &amp; Co. [and] Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., 1900-1950</emph>. They were then further culled in early June 1964 and were labeled as awaiting John Kouwenhoven's return to be reviewed. </p><p>Some files labeled as originating from the Tax Department are now included under that designation. General files from the Department are in chronological order, followed by client-specific folders in alphabetical order by last name. Information in them includes some of the individuals also represented in Subseries I.C. People. </p><p>Two books of stockholder records for Wall and Hanover Street Realty Co. are included as Volumes 9 and 10. Folders of Brown Bros. &amp; Co. correspondence marked with Kouwenhoven's Subject designation, but not included in the original filing cabinets and not annotated, have been added there. </p><p>Extracts of letters and other communications compiled into a volume (with index), which became disbound and is labeled in Kouwenhoven's handwriting as having originated from the Philadelphia office, is now included with those materials. There is some variation in the box order of these items because they are housed in different sized boxes</p><p>Various oversize photographic materials found organized separately in the Records but originally marked as belonging to the Subject files are now included here. Two photographs of lower Manhattan showing the Brown Brothers building at 59 Wall Street were not labeled with a subject heading; these have been added to the "Property" files. </p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="lcsh">Liverpool (England) -- Commerce.</geogname><genreform source="aat">Letters of credit.</genreform><subject source="lcsh">Insurance</subject><subject source="lcsh">Cotton trade</subject><subject source="lcsh">World War, 1939-1945 -- Finance</subject><subject source="lcsh">World War, 1914-1918 -- Finance</subject><subject source="lcsh">Merchants -- England -- Liverpool -- History -- 19th century.</subject><persname rules="rda" source="naf">Harriman, W.

A large amount of the information, especially that to do with Brown family members and partners, consists of cross-reference sheets pointing to items in other subseries of the Historical Files.</p><p>Some folders in Subseries C.i. had written on them the subject's lines of descent from Brown partners. These have been photocopied onto acid-free paper.</p><p>Among the clients in Subseries C.iii. are nobleman Otto of Hapsburg; playwright Philip Barry and his wife Ellen; poet Archibald Macleish at the time he served as Librarian of Congress; and humorist Dorothy Parker and her husband Alan Campbell, whose records include 1938 ticket stubs they claimed as deductible expenses. These materials may have come from Tax Department employee Catherine Barrett's scrapbooks, which are included in Series VI. Scrapbooks and Collected Materials.</p><p>Among the former employees in Subseries C.iv. who worked briefly for the firm were the son of New York diarist Philip Hone; and Edward Heath, who later served as England's Prime Minister.</p><p>There is some duplication of information about Brown family members in Subseries C.v. and vi., but most information on family members who were partners in the firm is included in the latter subseries. Materials include cross-reference sheets, genealogical information, clippings, photographs and other images, and information submitted by living current and retired partners in response to requests from Kouwenhoven. </p><p>Subseries C.vi. provides information on non-business aspects of the partners' lives and interests, including William Brown's donations in his home town of Liverpool, England; John Crosby Brown and William Adams Brown's involvement with Union Theological Seminary in New York City; and the extensive international political careers of W. Averell Harriman, Robert A. Lovett, and Robert V. Roosa. </p><p>Sarah B. Brown, who was John Crosby Brown's great-granddaughter, donated a significant amount of the material in her great-grandfather's files, including photographs and letters from his son James Brown to his wife Mary Elizabeth Adams Brown from France in 1917, where he was working for the American Red Cross. Subseries C.v. and vi. also document Mrs. Brown's research travels in support of material relevant to the Historical Files.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_af6aa4eddcf2e400d55e410de278d6ca"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The People files are arranged in their original six subsubseries</p><p>i.

The first report, submitted to the Executive Committee in 1897 by James Brown, he characterized as "somewhat of an experiment." Beginning in 1900, the reports were submitted by individual departments' managers and compiled for presentation.  Some are annotated in pencil by partner Thatcher M. Brown and others by an unidentified hand. They end in 1930, the year before Brown Brothers merged with the Harriman interests. </p><p>The 1912 report includes memoranda for its preparation: notes, calculations, adding machine tape. A note on the 1914 report reads "Mr. T. M. Brown would like some more convenient way of putting the various reports together." The 1926 report has a cover letter addressed to "Mr. Lovett": probably partner Robert A. Lovett.</p><p>Each report provides a snapshot of contemporary business practices as reflected in  staffing decisions and expenditures; areas identified for improvement; levels of  funding for a variety of activities; and contact with overseas branches, correspondent banks, and customers. They provide internal documentation, at the departmental level, of financial transactions, trends, and decisions reflected in Series III. Financial and Business Records and Series IV. Business Transaction Records.</p><p>Because the firm was a partnership, the Annual Reports are private and confidential, not the published documents required for a publicly held company answerable to shareholders. The Statements of Condition, however, were both printed and submitted to newspapers and summarize the firm's assets and liabilities. These include final printed versions, newspaper clippings from the scrapbooks of Miss Catherine Barrett (see Series VI. Scrapbooks and Collected Material), and annotated working versions showing required changes. </p><p>The Statements of Condition were donated to the Historical Files Library by Deputy Manager Clarence F. von Glahn in 1969.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_1d93e50bb94966b8b2587708a6d25bc8"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The Annual Reports are arranged chronologically, followed by the Statements of Condition in chronological order. The latter were originally housed individually by year in annotated folders. Information from the folders has been photocopied onto acid-free paper and precedes the materials described.</p><p>Two copies each of two advertisements that were the first Brown Brothers Harriman had ever placed in newspapers, which were included with these materials, have been  moved to Series VII. Promotional and Press Material.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1428_cuq" level="file"><did><unittitle>Annual Report 1897: James Brown report</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation"

Harriman, including ledger sheets, account books, and trial balances; salary books and partnership accounts; documentation of internal business practices including powers of attorney and statements of non-interest by employees in accounts handled by them on behalf of  customers; as well as external documents including individual and institutional customers' statements, transit documents, and receipts.</p><p>The specie shipment folders include information on the movement of barrels of gold coins from Brown Brothers &amp; Co. in New York to Brown Shipley &amp; Co. in Liverpool via steamship. This currency transportation, on vessels including those of the White Star, Imlay Imbrie &amp; Co., and Cunard Lines, ensured the correction of account balances between the houses and a more even foreign exchange.</p><p>The Partnership Journal (Volume 18) provides details of the 1926 unlimited liability partnership among W. Averell Harriman, E. Roland Harriman, and G.H. Walker "for the carrying on of a private banking business".</p><p>The statements of non-interest were in brittle wrappers marked "vault deposit", which have been preservation photocopied. Accompanying these records is documentation of other business-related records housed at one time in various company vaults.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_f9c7369b5bf6607a6cb9bdcd8bf37327"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The specie shipment materials consisted of a disbound volume in which were interleaved many loose pages. The latter are now foldered separately and identified by the date of the pages at which they were originally found.</p><p>The 1898 and 1919 unbound materials were originally each collected into cardboard folders.

Annual Reports and Statements of Condition and Series III. Financial and Business Records document primarily the internal accounting transactions and financial condition of Brown Brothers Harriman's precursor companies, this series documents a few of the firms' external financial activities and interests. It includes records of stocks sold in the Wall &amp; Hanover Street Realty Company; correspondence with individuals and organizations who purchased Russian ruble war loans in 1916, and with the International Bank of Commerce of Petrograd (some of which is in French), which held the bonds; bonds issued for foreign corporations and governments in the period 1925-1930; records of underwriting syndicates for the purchase of stocks and bonds in which Harriman Ripley &amp; Co., Inc., did and did not participate (including some of the bond issues documented in Volumes 22-34) from the late 1920s through the 1940s; minutes of the Finance Committee of Caledonian Insurance Company; and correspondence related to Frederick Dumaine's challenge to the purchase of the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railroad in 1968.</p><p>Volumes 23-34 were bound by the firm and include carbon copies of letters and telegrams, photostats of bond documents, and original printed offerings. Volumes 32 and 33 are identical duplicates.</p><p>The syndicate records consist predominantly of filled out (typed or handwritten) preprinted file cards arranged in tabbed alphabetical order by the name of the company or municipality offering being underwritten. They include details of prices paid, dates of offering and expiration, and selling commissions received.</p><p>The Delaware &amp; Hudson-related correspondence appears to have come from the files of John B. Madden, a Brown Brothers Harriman partner who had served since 1964 as a manager of the Delaware &amp; Hudson Company (a holding entity) and a director of the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railroad Corporation.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_7d3ea1897d599e1ee2f5684c476b20ac"><head>Historical Note</head><p>The Wall and Hanover Street Realty Company was constituted after the death of James Brown to capitalize the property on which Brown Brothers &amp; Co.'s headquarters stood, at 59 Wall Street, in order to distribute shares to his many heirs and other parties. </p><p>To finance the enormous debt it had incurred during World War I, the Russian imperial government issued bonds in 1916, some of which which were handled by Brown Brothers on behalf of individual and institutional customers. </p><p>The investment banking firm Harriman Ripley &amp; Co., Inc. (originally called Brown Harriman and Co. but renamed in 1938 to avoid confusion) was formed in 1934 after the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 mandated the separation of investment and commercial banking activities of individual firms. Its initial officers were four Brown Brothers Harriman partners and associates from National City Bank's securities affiliate. </p><p>Brown Brothers Harriman partner Knight Woolley was a director of Caledonian Insurance Company beginning in the 1930s. He served later as chair of its Finance Committee, to which the bank acted as investment advisor.</p><p>In 1968, Delaware &amp; Hudson Railroad's president and largest individual stockholder, Frederick Dumaine, Jr., unsuccessfully opposed a plan to sell the railroad to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad, which move was supported by Delware &amp; Hudson directors including Brown Brothers Harriman partners John B. Madden and E. Roland Harriman. The plan was intitially suggested by the Interstate Commerce Commission in an effort to balance the East Coast rail monopoly occasioned by the previous merger of the Pennsylvania and New York Central Railroads.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_c94581300fcdd7ab2f0ff7349eadff13"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The volumes are arranged chronologically, as are the foldered materials except as noted otherwise here.</p><p>The Russian ruble bond materials are often organized alphabetically within folders by name of correspondent, as noted on the folder labels.</p><p>The syndicate records consist predominantly of alphabetized runs of cards, which are arranged chronologically in different sized boxes from other materials in the series.</p><p>Some of the Delaware &amp; Hudson materials were originally foldered chronologically and those designations have been retained. More than half of the material was not originally organized and has been arranged by subject and then chronologically.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1614_3yw" level="file"><did><unittitle>Foreign Bond Department cables</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1916 January - June</unitdate><container id="aspace_f6b38c756b481c88c0b449d30f47a790" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022650]" type="Offsite-Box">89</container><container id="aspace_9dcdcc3b7b903d8778412077572b4c54" parent="aspace_f6b38c756b481c88c0b449d30f47a790" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1615_b17" level="file"><did><unittitle>Russian ruble bonds: correspondence with Banque Internationale de Commerce de Petrograd</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1916 January - August</unitdate><container id="aspace_4b1b0c761f71cbd64d1e0182e90bad18" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022650]" type="Offsite-Box">89</container><container id="aspace_b73a586b40c74a4cea768c1b4a392bb7" parent="aspace_4b1b0c761f71cbd64d1e0182e90bad18" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1616_z1g" level="file"><did><unittitle>Russian ruble bonds: securities sheets with account details</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1916 March - 1921 July</unitdate><container id="aspace_8ea0c654ba4d4d2622cb44b89c765657" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022650]" type="Offsite-Box">89</container><container id="aspace_fe5a7dbcc69b1cdadf366fbdcac7141e" parent="aspace_8ea0c654ba4d4d2622cb44b89c765657" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1617_co6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Russian ruble bonds: letters confirming sale of all orders - correspondents A-F</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1916 April 1 - September 1</unitdate><container id="aspace_1e4ffc5467c83be836dc1e5539b34b5e" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022650]" type="Offsite-Box">89</container><container id="aspace_727beac060662f9440d68f447084bfe6" parent="aspace_1e4ffc5467c83be836dc1e5539b34b5e" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1618_2ih" level="file"><did><unittitle>Russian ruble bonds: letters confirming sale of all orders - correspondents G-W</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1916 April 1 - September 1</unitdate><container id="aspace_d5b2db06579ae83614c4d9e3d473fd83" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022650]" type="Offsite-Box">89</container><container id="aspace_c9d29385b5a1f67218c4ee1309868caf" parent="aspace_d5b2db06579ae83614c4d9e3d473fd83" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1619_rme" level="file"><did><unittitle>Russian ruble bonds: correspondence covering orders on file - First National City Bank</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1916 April 1 - September 16</unitdate><container id="aspace_d704f74500c1b2be853bf84f662abeee" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022650]" type="Offsite-Box">89</container><container id="aspace_c9b567370a8a98cd27eeb55c25f584b0" parent="aspace_d704f74500c1b2be853bf84f662abeee" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1620_s1q" level="file"><did><unittitle>Russian ruble bonds: sale amounts and dates by customer</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1916 April - October</unitdate><container id="aspace_1527822938f9e5a4228ffe22370fb186" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022650]" type="Offsite-Box">89</container><container id="aspace_f4a545c02ddde4b49c05648a24aa9666" parent="aspace_1527822938f9e5a4228ffe22370fb186" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1621_rek" level="file"><did><unittitle>Russian ruble bonds: First National Bank correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1916 June - 1917 March</unitdate><container id="aspace_116072e8acf8a8631a68d61058494006" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022650]" type="Offsite-Box">89</container><container id="aspace_9b11b256550e478ad9f8ea65e74bb683" parent="aspace_116072e8acf8a8631a68d61058494006" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1622_qqy" level="file"><did><unittitle>Russian ruble bonds: items selected as interesting by Sarah B.

The objective was to effect currency reform, overhaul the Pacific Railway, and establish a national bank, of which Brown served as president from 1912 to 1914. Congress later opened inquiries into the loans and their dissemination as part of a general review of so-called Dollar Diplomacy. He was instrumental in arranging the first dollar (rather than sterling) denominated commercial export syndicate credits through the Bank of France in 1915. During World War I he represented American bankers at negotiations with European governments regarding wartime financing, conferring with Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George,  Bank of England governor Lord Cunliffe, and representatives of European banking concerns.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_0bea81f7bf638b4cbfc5d0dee03fa17f"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The 1910 to 1917 diaries are handwritten (some in pencil that is difficult to decipher), interspersed with typed minutes and proceedings from meetings of Brown Brothers &amp; Co.'s Policy Committee until 1912, and paginated to page 68.

From 1907-1946 he was a member of Presbyterian Hospital's Board of Managers, for which in 1925 he chaired a campaign committee for the hospital's contributions to the $10 million fund for Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was also an elder of the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church.</p><p>Among his corporate director- and trusteeships were Commercial Union Group, Prudential Insurance Company of London, Sun Insurance Company, Skandia Insurance Company of Stockholm, and Bank of Savings of New York. The precursor of Royal Insurance Company, The Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company, held its first meeting in January 1851 in the offices of Brown Brothers &amp; Co., of which Thatcher Brown's grandfather James was a partner who served as a director of the insurance company. Thatcher Brown and his father, James Brown's son John Crosby Brown, likewise served as directors of the firm.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_099e1b05617be4db656e2aa29cc69a93"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The materials were originally organized into personal correspondence, business correspondence, financial/tax documents, and a box of culled correspondence individually labeled in an unidentified hand. That order has been preserved, except where changes were necessary for clarity, with division into three subseries.</p><p>Subseries C.i. Personal and Family Materials includes personal correspondence of both Thatcher and Caro Noyes Brown, as well as to do with their apartment at 139 east 79th street, Thatcher Brown's estate work for family members including his wife Caro and his brother James Crosby Brown, club memberships, and charitable work for various institutions.</p><p>Subseries C.ii. Business Records includes records related to Thatcher Brown's nonfamily business interests, including estates work, and correspondence with Brown Brothers &amp; Co. and Brown Brothers Harriman. Financial records related only to Thatcher Brown's business interests are included here.</p><p>Subseries C.iii. Financial Records includes personal checks and checkbooks of Thatcher and Caro Noyes Brown (mostly from accounts used to pay charitable contributions), tax preparation documents and returns, and financial records related to the estate and trusts under the will of Caro Noyes Brown.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1559_9qn" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries C.i. Personal and Family Materials (1890-1966)</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_05f79e4bce4cc5a1b9ef4a08868556fc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The subseries includes personal and family-related correspondence and other records of both Thatcher and Caro Noyes Brown.</p><p>Caro Noyes's letters from her 1898-1899 trip to Liverpool, London, Paris, Rouen, Naples, Rome, and Switzerland include drawings in her hand of purchases of clothes and accessories, a description of the funeral of French President Faure, and a pressed edelweiss from Pontresina, in the Swiss Alps. The letters, which are occasionally annotated in red in another hand, mention various Delano family members (to whom she was related through her mother and would also later be through her husband), and include a letter from Susan Delano thanking Mr. Noyes for the loan of his daughters.</p><p>Her letters from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut, and a dance card with the names of both Thatcher and James Crosby Brown, indicate that she knew both brothers while they attended Yale University in nearby New Haven. </p><p>The letters of Montagu Norman, who was a Brown Brothers partner and Governor of the Bank of England, to Caro Noyes Brown are affectionate and often apologetic for not having written sooner. After 1933, letters from his wife Priscilla include descriptions of life in pre-war and wartime Britain. The correspondence was used by Sir Henry Clay in researching his 1957 biography <emph render="italic">Lord Norman</emph> and includes notes from Clay at that time. </p><p>Letters during World War II to Thatcher and Caro Brown from Gertrude Balfour (1877-1970), who was Montagu Norman's sister and the wife of Scottish botanist Alistair Balfour (1873-1945), have text cut out where they were redacted by the censor.</p><p>Much of Thatcher Brown's personal material pertains to the estates of family members for whom he served as executor, including his brother James Crosby Brown, cousin Moreau Delano, and wife Caro Noyes Brown. As part of his brother's estate, Thatcher Brown donated the Pasque Island property deeds to Dukes County Historical Society (now the Martha's Vineyard Museum) and sold the property to then Massachusetts Governor Forbes. He corresponded extensively with family members and with staff at Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, regarding the upkeep and improvement of various family plots there. </p><p>The correspondence with his brother William Adams Brown is mostly to do with managing the latter's investments, but also discusses a loan of their mother Mary Elizabeth Adams Brown's instruments from the Metropolitan Museum. William Adams Brown's 1933 letters after a visit to Germany record his impressions of the political and economic situation there and include some newspaper clippings in German. </p><p>Correspondence with his son Daniel Noyes Brown is likewise mostly to do with investments, but the 1943 letters detail Daniel's experience while serving in the military in North Africa.</p><p>An English impression of the impending war is provided in the 1939 letters from Edward Clifton-Brown; his wartime letters record conditions on the home front as well as the whereabouts of various family members and firm employees. </p><p>Thatcher Brown's personal involvement with fundraising and other efforts for charitable institutions in around New York City is reflected in the records for the Building Fund of Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church; during his service as treasurer of 1st Presbyterian Church in Rumson, New Jersey; and with St. Cloud Church, where his mother had had a marker installed after the demolition of a spring house provided by her husband John Crosby Brown. The church's Men's Club had been established with funds from the John Crosby Brown estate.</p><p>Thatcher and Caro Brown initially rented an apartment at 139 east 79th street, which was later converted to a cooperative plan. Thatcher Brown helped to form that plan, served on the building's Board, and Mrs. Brown owned half of the proprietary lease on the commercial property on the building's ground floor.</p><p>Chester Jay Hunt was a Yale classmate (1897) of Thatcher Brown's who wrote many letters detailing his financial woes while running a bulb-growing company and later about the inadequacies of his New Jersey state pension. Thatcher Brown assisted him with job possibilities, took up a collection for his benefit from Yale classmates, loaned him money, and made frequent gifts of cash and checks. He also corresponded extensively over the same period with fellow Yale Fund class agent George Parmly Day about the class's charitable efforts on behalf of Hunt.</p><p>In 1950, Brown had privately printed and distributed <emph render="italic">Brown Brothers &amp; Co. [and] Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., 1900-1950</emph>, a continuation of his father's account of the firm's first 100 years. Copies of the book that were with the related correspondence are now included in Series X. Published Material.</p><p>Caro Noyes Brown's bride's book (Volume 60) for her June 3, 1904, marriage in St. Paul, Minnesota, includes signatures of ushers and bridesmaids from the Adams, Moore, Coe, Brown, and Delano families. Her 1929 diary (Volume 61) is from a trip to South America, during which her husband was guest of honor at dinner given by the Mayor of Lima, Peru (see illustration on p. 195 of <emph render="italic">Partners in Banking</emph>).</p><p>The household inventory in Volume 62 is illustrated with pencil sketches of individual items and annotated with their location in Thatcher Brown's homes (775 Park Avenue in 1932; 139 east 79th Street in 1943), purchase prices, provenance, and any disposition after sale.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_cd5e3b5a259717ee5e184e12809df2ae"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Thatcher Brown served as executor, financial and investment advisor, and banker for many members of the extended Brown, Delano, and Noyes families, including his cousins, nieces, and nephews.</p><p>A son of John Crosby Brown, Thatcher Brown's siblings were William Adams Brown (1865-1943), Eliza Coe Brown (called Bessie, 1868-1959), Mary Magoun Brown (1869-1962), James Crosby Brown (1872-1930), and Amy Brighthurst Brown (1878-1960).</p><p>In 1892, William Adams Brown (1865-1943) married Helen Gilman Noyes, whose sister Caro Lord Noyes would marry Thatcher Brown in 1904. William and Helen Noyes Brown's children were John Crosby Brown (1892-1950), William Adams Brown (1894-1957), Winthrop Gilman Brown (1907-1987), and Helen Adams Brown (1910-1928). In 1936 William Adams Brown retired after 40 years on the faculty at Union Theological Seminary.</p><p>Eliza Coe Brown married Edward Caldwell Moore (b. 1857) in 1887 and their three children were Dorothea May Moore (1884-1995), who in 1941 married Arthur Burkhard (1891-1973); John Crosby Brown Moore (1897-1993), principal of the architectural firm of Dunham and Moore in New York City; and Elizabeth Ripley Moore (1907-1983).</p><p>Mary Magoun Brown trained as a nurse at Presbyterian Hospital and began her career in 1899 on the staff of the Henry Street Settlement Visiting Nursing. She retired in 1951 after 50 years of service.</p><p>James Crosby Brown died unexpectedly in 1930, leaving a large and complicated estate valued, even after the stock market crash of 1929, at over $1.5 million, and of which Thatcher Brown was executor. It included Clifton Wynyates, a 194 acre property in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, as well as land on Pasque Island, Massachusetts. After his death, his widow moved from the Pennsylvania property, and by 1933 it was being subdivided by developers Durham and James.</p><p>In 1898 James Crosby Brown had married Mary Agnes Hewlett (1875-1919) and had two sons: James Crosby Brown (called Crosby, 1903-1965) and Alexander Crosby Brown (called Alec, 1905-1993). In 1921, he married Aurelia Gladys Pomeroy Jenkins (1883-1938), the widow of a Yale classmate and mother of Allston Jenkins (called Allie, 1903-1994). The guardian of their daughter, Aurelia Clifton Brown (called Thistle, b. 1925), after her mother's death was her half-brother Allston (who was also executor of his mother's estate), and she lived at one time with her uncle Thatcher Brown. </p><p>Amy Brighthurst Brown (1878-1960) married Henry Lockwood de Forest (1875-1954) in 1899 and had three children: May de Forest (1902-1990); Emily Johnston de Forest  (1903-1977), whose second husband was Leslie Tillotson Webster (1893-1943); and Robert Weeks de Forest, who died at birth in September, 1909. Henry Lockwood de Forest's sister Frances Emily (b. 1878) was the wife of William Adams Walker Stewart.</p><p>Caro Lord Noyes Brown's (1876-1947) mother, Helen Gilman Noyes, was the sister of Serena Hale Davenport. Caro and Thatcher Brown's three children were Moreau Delano Brown (1905-1974), who became a Brown Brothers Harriman partner in 1939; Daniel Noyes Brown (1906-1985), who trained as a physician at Columbia University; and Thatcher Magoun Brown (1908-1983). </p><p>The children of Thatcher Brown's maternal aunt and uncle Sarah Magoun Adams and Brown Brothers partner Eugene Delano included partner Moreau Delano (1877-1936; see Subseries I.C.vi. Partners); William Adams Delano (1874-1960), the architect of, among many other buildings, the Rockefeller estate Kykuit, Otto Kahn's Oheka, and Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney's Old Westbury studio; Caroline Delano (called Lina), who married Dr. Augustus B. Wadsworth and was the mother of Eugene Delano Wadsworth; Augustus Baldwin Wadsworth; and botanist and supporter of Harvard University's Arnold Arboretum, Susan Adams Delano McKelvey (1883-1964).</p><p>In London, partner Edward Clifton-Brown (1870-1944; see Subseries I.C.vi. Partners) was a great-grandson of Sir William Brown (1784-1864,) who established the family firm in Liverpool. Edward's paternal uncle was London partner Sir Alexander Hargreaves Brown (1844-1922; see Subseries I.C.vi. Partners); his son was Anthony Clifton-Brown (1903-1984).</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_e91f5696bb84d6cc842f6bd165e8d456"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is arranged chronologically; within the chronological arrangement, many of the subjects have multiple files bearing the same title, which are themselves organized chronologically.</p><p>Placed at the beginning of the series is an annotated inventory of the carton containing personal correspondence of Thatcher Brown, originally in the possession of his son Moreau D.

"Property" files).</p><p>Brown Brothers &amp; Co. sold the building (by selling the stock in Wall &amp; Hanover Realty Co.) to developer Starrett Brothers to build a new, larger structure to the firm's specifications, which opened in May, 1929. Brown Brothers &amp; Co., along with other tenants, became lessees of office space in the new building, and the firm brought with it paneling and other details from the original building. It occupied the basement, ground, first, mezzanine, and second floors of the new building. At the firm's behest, Starrett employed the architecture firm of Delano &amp; Aldrich (see Subseries V.C.i., Biographical Note, for an explanation of William Adams Delano's  relationship to the Brown family); 59 Wall Street was the architects' only skyscraper design.</p><p>The new building expanded on the previous property to include parts of the building at 61 Wall Street, but was oriented to retain the historical address and unique diagonal doorway design of the original structure. While construction on the new building was underway, Brown Brothers &amp; Co. leased space at 37 Wall Street previously occupied by the Equitable Trust Company.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_60691e230742d504ed4b931ff1f02a64"><head>Arrangement</head><p>These materials were housed separately from the "Property" files in Subseries I.B.

To retain their original provenance, they have been included here; researchers interested in the 59-61 Wall Street building and its history should consult materials in both series for more complete information on this subject.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1897_ngv" level="file"><did><unittitle>John A.

His responsibilities included promoting the Marshall Plan and effecting it through detailed negotiations with American businesses and trade promotion associations; ensuring increased sales for American products overseas; and rebuilding postwar Europe while forestalling, it was hoped, the growth of Communist governments there. Among the officials Lovett met with on a regular basis were Secretary of State George Marshall, Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, White House counsel Clark Clifford, advisors George Kennan and Dean Rusk, U.S. Representatives and Senators, committee chairs, and Brown Brothers Harriman partner W.

Lovett during his World War II government service; clippings from the banking press including predominantly statements of condition; tearsheets from a profile of Brown Brothers Harriman published in <emph render="italic">Business Week</emph> in 1958, together with color and black and white photographic prints, including those used in the article; and messages of condolence received from the firm's clients, customers, and vendors after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</p><p>The Introduction books are arranged alphabetically by individuals' last names and include the name of the person who introduced them (usually an outside organization or person with ties to Brown Brothers), and comments that include the nature of their business or the outcome of the contact.</p><p>The Tax Department scrapbooks contain predominantly commercial newspaper clippings, correspondence, and some clippings from Brown Brothers employee publications. Miss Barrett, who retired from Brown Brothers Harriman in 1964 after 42 years of service, seems to have functioned as an informal clipping service for the firm. The books (the first three of which are numbered sequentially) are organized into those pertaining to Brown Brothers Harriman offices; personnel and employees, some of which are annotated with details of individuals' employment and affiliation within the company or the Brown family; partners, including separate volumes for W. Averell Harriman and Robert A. Lovett, and extensive coverage of E.R. Harriman's tenure as Chairman of the Red Cross and its role in mediating the release of prisoners taken in the aborted Bay of Pigs invasion; Brown and other partners' families, including almost exclusively newspaper clippings documenting births, marriages, and deaths; clients of the firm in general but particularly the Tax Department; statements of condition, which duplicate some of those found in Series II. Annual Reports and Statements of Condition, or may have been the original source for them; and publications including "Personality of a Bank" created for outside use, employee handbooks detailing practices and procedures for new hires, and "The Fifty-Niner," published during World War II for employees in the armed services to keep them apprised of and connected to events on the home front.</p><p>Some materials include questions on them in Sarah B. Brown's handwriting that are answered in Miss Barrett's writing. It appears that they were provided to the Historical Files for their research value in the writing of <emph render="italic">Partners in Banking</emph>. </p><p>The partner and family sections provide some detailed genealogical information that may complement information in Subseries I.C.vi. Partners and Series V. Partners Papers. In the client sections, a copy of the Brunner affidavit (seeking restitution for wartime damages) gives details of banking procedures and subterfuges for the protection of clients' identities and assets in Belgium under German occupation between 1940 and 1944.</p><p>The Lovett scrapbook (Volume 68) includes newspaper clippings, some sourced from a clipping service. The cover of its oversized album is an image from "Peace map of the world united:  a pictorial history of transportation and communications" that was  distributed by Oliver K. Whiting of London from a drawing by Ernest Dudley Chase, of Winchester, MA. Both front and back depict an idealized future in which world peace results from technological advances in mass communications and travel combined with the rejection of isolationism.</p><p>The Kennedy condolence messages (typed, handwritten, and telexes) are in alphabetical order by the writers' country of origin. Each is accompanied by a carbon copy of the reply from partners including F. H. Kingsbury, Jr., and John Madden. Most include a cc to L. Parks Shipley ("LPS") who was the partner responsible for the firm's lending overseas. Each one thanks the writer for his or her condolences, attests to the country's confidence in new-President Johnson's policies, including, in letters to South American correspondents, his affirmation of continued friendly trading policies there. Received in the days and weeks following the assassination, the messages are short, direct, and heart-felt and document the shock felt worldwide.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_c4226bed9c7d05f4d3503d63a5add9ba"><head>Historical Note</head><p>Books of introduction were used by banking firms to track contacts and their connections to employees and partners. In some cases they provided documentation of referrals made by partners to outside individuals and were used to determine the appropriate commissions due.</p><p>After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, American companies were the recipients of an outpouring of condolence messages from their overseas customers, contractors, and suppliers.

No studio, photographer, or location is identified, but they would appear to have been taken in the Middle East, and using two cameras rather than a camera with two lenses, based on the blurring in one side of one of the images.</p><p>The glass plate negatives of John Crosby Brown's New Jersey home, Brighthurst, were donated to the Historical Files in 1966 by his grandson John Crosby Brown Moore.</p><p>The black and white photographs by Guy Gillette and Matar Studios were commissioned for use in the second edition of the brochure "Personality of a Bank", issued in 1967. The firm's first promotional publication, it was originally issued in 1959. Further information about the publication, including additional prints, is included in the "1959" files in Subseries I.A. Chronological Files. </p><p>Some images from the 1968 sesquicentennial celebrations (provided by the Union Pacific Railroad) in Seattle and Sun Valley were reproduced in personalized leather-bound scrapbooks presented to each guest. The book presented to Juan Trippe, who as president of Pan American World Airways was instrumental in inspiring Boeing to create the 747 jetliner, is <extref xlink:href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/album.html">item 109 in the Print Room's album collection</extref> at New-York Historical Society.</p><p>Some snapshots from the Sun Valley events were contributed to the Historical Files by Alice B. Brown, wife of partner Moreau Delano Brown; others were taken by Malcolm Freudy of Freudy Photos, New York City.</p><p>The 1995 materials consist of two groups (marked A and B) of images originally from the Historical Files and from the Walker Evans portfolio (see Subseries VIII.B.), which were rehoused separately from the other visual materials in 1995. No explanation for this is provided in the Collection.

It began in Seattle, Washington, with dinner one evening at the Space Needle and the next at the home of Boeing's president William Allen, after guests had had a tour of the Boeing facility where the first 747 jetliner was being constructed. From Seattle, guests boarded two Union Pacific trains for the trip overland to Shoshone, Idaho, and traveled thence by bus to Sun Valley for two days of seminars, social events, and leisure activities. </p><p>A celebration for staff, families, and guests was held in New York on October 9, 1968. It began with an Open House at the firm's headquarters at 59 Wall Street and continued at a re-creation of the 1818 New York waterfront on pier 13 at the foot of Wall Street. It featured food, drinks, and entertainment of the period, with catering by Restaurant Associates. Among the guests was New York Mayor John V. Lindsay.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_e08a73736b9a4167bb3e80e940af7ef4"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The five glass plate negatives showing rooms at John Crosby Brown's New Jersey home, Brighthurst; the two framed portraits of Montagu Norman; and the view of James Brown's house at 9th Street and University Place were removed from Subseries I.C.vi.  Partners. They are housed separately from the other materials in this subseries because of their size and fragility.</p><p>The stereograph images were found loose in John Crosby Brown's 1859-1860 scrapbook of pressed plants and flowers (Subseries V.B. Partners. John Crosby Brown, volume 36).</p><p>The prints, contacts, and negatives by photographer Guy Gillette and by Matar Studios were originally housed with materials included in Subseries VIII.B.

However, because much of the company's evolution after 1945 did not provide extensive graphic material, Kouwenhoven decided to end the book with a commissioned photographic portfolio depicting the contemporary organization, its partners, and locations.</p><p>For this he chose photographer Walker Evans, who was ending his career as Special Photographic Editor at <emph render="italic">Fortune</emph> Magazine. During his tenure there from 1945 to 1964, Evans had completed numerous self-assigned photographic studies of the contemporary business environment, its practitioners and tools. He brought to these the same eye for detail and sociological import that had informed his best-known and most provocative images: those documenting rural poverty for the Resettlement (later, Farm Security) Administration during the Depression, and his photographs of Greensboro, Alabama, farming families originally published, with James Agee, as <emph render="italic">Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</emph> in 1941. </p><p>The Brown Brothers Harriman portfolio may be the last that Evans made as a corporate documenter, and only 56 of the close to 300 images he made for the project were published in <emph render="italic">Partners in Banking</emph>. In 1965 he was named Professor of Photography on the Faculty for Graphic Design at the Yale School of Art and Architecture. Before his death in 1975, Evans experimented with the new instant Polaroid SX-70 camera and lectured and published on his collections of vernacular images, including an extensive postcard collection.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_d211e5761caa3ea5411fb0446164cf4d"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is organized in three sections: </p><p>Subseries VIII.B.i.

A sample card provided by Evans, with a handwritten and signed explanation, appears to be the prototype. </p><p>Each mount is stamped with the Historical Files' stamp and dated. Many are accompanied by separate captions in Sarah B. Brown's hand (some edited in another hand); photocopies of her originals; and/or typed captions on adhesive-backed paper, some adhered to the mount and some loose. Some of the Philadelphia office photographs are captioned on the back in pencil, in Evans's hand. Images used in the book ("P.I.B") are marked on the back with their respective page numbers.</p><p>His biographer, Jeff Rosenheim, has described Evans's business-environment photographs as documenting "the office as cultural artifact." These images of wealthy and powerful men, in their work and home environments and with the tools and possessions that define them, can easily be compared with Evans's images of farmers and migrant workers who are likewise defined by their bereft environment and paltry possessions. </p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_08a95e6b1588228fbf03e156b43e7fe1"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The materials were originally stored in three large record center cartons. They have been rehoused in acid-free folders in archival document boxes. The accompanying captions, originally paper-clipped to the mounted prints, have been preservation photocopied and precede the prints that they describe. The prints are ordered as they were in the original boxes, using the descriptions on the dividers that identified groups of images. There is significant repetition of images in some of the groups. The numbering of these boxes is out of order because of their different sizes.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2102_x8l" level="file"><did><unittitle>Exterior Philadelphia office; New York offices of partners Lovett, Ireland, Gerry and Shipley, Kingsbury </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1965 March 31; 1966 October 6, November 17</unitdate><container id="aspace_5ecbcad5942347d22b3cdd705c8d7744" label="Graphic Materials [10170000022681]" type="Offsite-Box">122</container><container id="aspace_8919d45e04bffcf33fca962b3e879a30" parent="aspace_5ecbcad5942347d22b3cdd705c8d7744" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2103_riv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Partners Room and desks, New York City; Philadelphia office interior</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1965 March 31; 1966 November 17</unitdate><container id="aspace_0cc450c40d0428420489e9cce23a07de" label="Graphic Materials [10170000022681]" type="Offsite-Box">122</container><container id="aspace_d737025289df107d53cd0eb074a7512a" parent="aspace_0cc450c40d0428420489e9cce23a07de" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2104_3zs" level="file"><did><unittitle>Partners and office, New York City: E.R.
