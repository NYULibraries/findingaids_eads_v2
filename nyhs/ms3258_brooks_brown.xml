    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Genevieve Brooks Brown was born Genevieve Smith on July 12, 1937, one of four daughters of cotton farmers Anderson and Birdie Lee (Hill) Smith of Anderson, South Carolina. She graduated from the Anderson County Training School in 1954, and moved the following year to New York City, where she lived in Manhattan with an aunt and uncle while attending the Combination Business School on 125th Street in Harlem. Her coursework there (she received a diploma in 1959) in shorthand, typing, and addressograph machine operation allowed her to find employment as an executive secretary, and later as a bookkeeper and an office manager. She later moved to her own apartment in the Bronx, where a neighbor introduced her to Herbert Lee Brooks (1934–1971), a building inspector for the City of New York, whom she married in 1962.<lb/>
<lb/>
The couple eventually settled at 1555 Seabury Place, an apartment building in Crotona Park East, which was then a thriving neighborhood of families who patronized local businesses. As working-class White and African-American residents began departing the area for newer developments like Co-op City, the once-stable area declined rapidly. When Brooks pointed out her building's neglect to the landlord, he said she was the only one to complain and suggested she move to a more upscale location on Park Avenue or somewhere in Queens. When she urged fellow tenants to voice their concerns, they received the same non-response. This ignited her interest in community activism, and led her to organize the 1555 Seabury Tenants' Association, the first of many groups on whose boards she served and that shared the common goal of bettering the lives and working conditions for residents of the Bronx.<lb/>
<lb/>
In 1974 Genevieve Brooks convened with church leaders and local organizations to form the "Mid-Bronx Desperadoes" (officially incorporated as the MBD Community Housing Corporation), which, as of today, has created over 5,000 units of affordable housing. The MBD's most well-known project, Charlotte Gardens—a mix of modern apartment buildings and smaller, ranch-style homes in a tree-lined setting—rose on the rubble of Charlotte Street, the blighted state of which came to national attention after the visits of Presidents Carter and Reagan in 1977 and 1980.<lb/>
<lb/>
Brooks's tireless activism brought her to the attention of Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, who recognized her as "an architect of the New Bronx." He appointed her Deputy Bronx Borough President in April 1990. She was the first woman in the post, which she held until January 1998. During her tenure she hosted the visits of such notable figures as President Bill Clinton and New York's Governor Mario Cuomo, and in 1997 received the National Civic League's All-America City Award on behalf of the Bronx.<lb/>
<lb/>
Brooks married her second husband, John Brown (b. 1935) on June 21, 2000, and soon after retired with him to her native South Carolina, where she continues to be active in church affairs and as chairperson of the AARP Anderson Chapter 3693.<lb/>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Genevieve S. Brooks Brown Papers reflect their creator's community activism in the Bronx during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, when she founded, worked with (often in a voluntary capacity), or served on the boards of such organizations as the Seabury Place Block Association, the Seabury Day Care Center, the Bronx Model Cities Policy Committee, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), and B.U.L.B. (Black United Leadership in the Bronx). [See Series II.]<lb/>
<lb/>
Perhaps the most publicized of Brooks Brown's activities was the creation in 1974 of the Mid-Bronx Desperadoes (officially the MBD Community Housing Corporation), in which she drew together representatives from area churches and local associations to address the desperate situation (hence the group's name) faced by residents of Crotona Park East, who were plagued by arson, crime, and the closure of businesses. President Carter visited Charlotte Street, the most decayed section of the neighborhood in 1977, infamously calling it "the worst slum in America." President Regan, in 1980, compared it to "burned-out London in World War II." Following this, The MBD, in conjunction with New York City's South Bronx Development Office, successfully transformed the rubble into Charlotte Gardens, a community of ranch-style homes on tree-lined streets. [See Series III.]<lb/>
<lb/>
Brooks Brown was appointed Deputy Bronx Borough President by then-President Fernando Ferrer. During her tenure from 1990 until 1998, she coordinated agency professionals and community-based organizations in the planning and improving of housing and municipal service delivery, while overseeing a staff of 150. [See Series IV.]<lb/>
<lb/>
The collection includes photographs from Brooks Brown's many activities, some of them documenting parades she marshalled (like the Bronx African Caribbean Heritage Parade with Reverend Al Sharpton, 1996) and events she hosted (like the visit of President Bill Clinton to the Madison Boys &amp; Girls Club, 1997). [See Series V.] It also includes the audio files and printed transcripts of interviews she and a number of associates gave to Julie Sandorf in December, 2019. [See Series VI.]<lb/>
<lb/>
A small amount of personal material, such as Brooks Brown's high school diploma (1954) and certificates from her secretarial courses at the Harlem-based Combination Business School (1959), rounds out the collection. [See Series I.]</p>  </scopecontent>
