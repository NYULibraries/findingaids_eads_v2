<p>The NYU Abu Dhabi Memory Project is an ongoing archival oral history project that seeks to record the history of NYU Abu Dhabi and the historical memories, experiences, and knowledge of members of the NYU Abu Dhabi community. The collection includes both video and audio recorded oral history interviews, conducted both in-person and remotely from 2019-Present. Drawing on the concept of storytelling in knowledge management, the NYUAD Archivist regularly conducts with individuals and groups as a way to enhance understanding about NYUAD's people, spaces, culture, research, programs, and community traditions. </p><p>Anyone interested in understanding the NYU Abu Dhabi community -- its people, its spaces, its culture, community traditions -- will find this body of interviews valuable. The coming together of recording stories is also a meaningful activity on its own, leading to the archiving of group origin stories that will be preserved for future generations. Stories of migration to and from Abu Dhabi and the UAE, as well as impressions of the region, are also discussed. </p><p>Interviews conducted have been summarized, and some have edited transcripts. As the project is continuously ongoing and iteratively processed, users may inquire about available transcripts. </p>  </scopecontent>

<p>The project began as an oral history storytelling effort to commemorate the University's 10th Anniversary, and was branded the "NYU Abu Dhabi Memory Project" in September 2019. In October 2019, the project launched a pilot effort during the University's first Alumni Weekend, which welcomed back the Class of 2014. Attendees were invited to volunteer for a 30-minute interview session with interviewers from the Archives asking questions such as first impressions of Abu Dhabi, memories of the Downtown Campus (DTC) and Sama Tower days. Alumni, faculty, and staff participated. </p><p>Since 2019, the project has evolved into one of the primary methods for acquiring knowledge about the NYU Abu Dhabi campus for the University Archives. </p>  </bioghist>

Answering a call for participation, interviewees in seven sessions signed up to record their memories on Friday, October 10, 2019, in between reunion activities. These short form sessions were guided by a set of general prompts and questions that archivists Brad Bauer or Lauren Kata asked, while digital media specialist Rebecca Pittam recorded. The sessions took place in "The Living Room," a quiet space facilitated by the Campus Life (Student Affairs) that the Memory Project team booked specifically for the recordings.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_8a179c6fd6daa648c513fce618e54007" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview session with Goffredo Puccetti and Brad Bauer (29:23)</unittitle><unitid>ADRG023_001</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/25160</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">29 minutes</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">42.75 Gigabytes</extent></physdesc><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">09 Oct 2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_5e9c8a85c90e96a09d2ae0710dddfb38" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_cca27f74e4e96853383ba6f07eb19b02" parent="aspace_5e9c8a85c90e96a09d2ae0710dddfb38" type="folder">ADRG023_001</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_039c7b4f7ae0b22f0dbadfcb82c3cc73"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Video-recorded session with Goffredo Puccetti, Assistant Professor of Practice of Visual Arts, recorded on October 9, 2019, and interviewed by Brad Bauer, Librarian for Archives and Special Collections at NYUAD Library.

He reminisces on his challenges in freshman year transitioning from an Indian system to an American system, and how he was able to overcome those challenges through close access to teaching assistants, professors and deans. He also discusses his time in New York which was completely different to Abu Dhabi in terms of academic culture, city culture and level of independence. Abishek is adamant that NYU Abu Dhabi's greatest lesson is that you can do anything you set your mind to.  </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_93e98ce91791a9a8f3cb0cf562415a11" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview Session with Janos Kun and Lauren Kata (19:13)</unittitle><unitid>ADRG023_006</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/26090</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">10 Oct 2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_51b40030ee83ed8ba4b0bdd0ee9c0ec7" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_ddaa2b73d184b2310f4e07a0ab4da5e7" parent="aspace_51b40030ee83ed8ba4b0bdd0ee9c0ec7" type="folder">ADRG023_006</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_dad3f1ed23ad2a8790ed1216b9a56a58"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Video-recorded Memory Project session with Janos Kun, Class of 2014 alumnus recorded on Thursday, October 10, 2019, and facilitated by Lauren Kata, Assistant Librarian for Archives and Special Collections at NYUAD Library.

Jay shares his story of starting a career in fitness at NYUAD, and Hazel describes her first days of working at the Career Center as daunting, but exciting at the same time. They describe the evolution of their respective departments over time. Hazel and Jay talk about their special places off-campus, such as Foodlands for shawarma, a park opposite to the Grand Mosque for sunset-watching, and Mushrif Park for walks with their daughter.

Recordings and transcripts are preserved in the NYUAD University Archives.</p><p>Francesca and Goffredo recall their transition from living in Europe to their new lives at NYU Abu Dhabi. For the pair, it was not a difficult decision as they were both mobile with their careers. Language was a point of contention for Francesca who had only acted in French and Italian, and then had to move to an environment that was English and Arabic-based. They describe the move from the Downtown Campus where they would frequently hear the call to prayer, and labs were based in apartments, to the newer and more spacious Saadiyat campus. Becoming Faculty Fellows in Residence was integral to their experience at NYU Abu Dhabi. The FFIR model underwent adaptation from the NYU structure due to differences in goals and logistics, and the importance of FFIRs in supporting community discussions in grey areas. As FFIRs they became heavily involved with students and the community, cultivating traditions such as Tiramisu Night, Meet Greet and Eat, and Twirl It Like Luigi. They were also able to foster connections between students themselves, as well as between students and external guests such as Charlie Carmada and Alfio Quarteroni who visited the NYUAD Institute.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_97cc8827801dc27718196e4be1e51986" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview session with Matteo Marciano and Lauren Kata (47:16)</unittitle><unitid>ADRG023_009</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/26093</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020-02-18/2020-02-18">18 Feb 2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_fde406ea2c8ddf7d3abe1ef1d5a5d278" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_c654df4809a0c88fcfd3cbe56c94fac8" parent="aspace_fde406ea2c8ddf7d3abe1ef1d5a5d278" type="folder">ADRG023_009</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1aae22d9ca245fdb4271774df757f8cb"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Video-recorded Memory Project session with Matteo Marciano, Assistant Program Head and Assistant Professor of Practice of Music Technology at NYU Abu Dhabi, recorded on Tuesday, February 18, 2020 and facilitated by Lauren Kata, Assistant Librarian for Archives and Special Collections at NYUAD Library.

Through the community meals, they have sought to break through the superficiality of the standard visiting artist experience and build an intimate, community centered moment that forges new relationships and links artists to NYU Abu Dhabi, and the UAE as a whole. Sharing several anecdotes of interactions from the past five years, they offer a glimpse into the moments that make the community meals special. Despite the many challenges of the event, Bragin and Bostwick discuss its integral role in the Arts Center's mission and how to keep it a priority in the coming years. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_923aa53b6ecb18398739c64627e4fd1c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview session with Malak Abdel-Ghaffar, Sara Pan Algarra, Alicja Borzyszkowska, Ian Hoyt (ElevatED), and Lauren Kata (44:44)</unittitle><unitid>ADRG023_014</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/26101</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">07 May 2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_c2d10dec23d1c601744d50dc66cf9536" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_40d602f8a38ea71d19dca26a521581a9" parent="aspace_c2d10dec23d1c601744d50dc66cf9536" type="folder">ADRG023_014</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a864e651de19998fdd493e9f22d582f2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Video-recorded session with NYUAD students Malak Abdel-Ghaffar, Sara Pan Algarra, Alicja Borzyszkowska, and Ian Hoyt, recorded on Thursday, May 7, 2020, and facilitated by Lauren Kata, Assistant Academic Librarian for Archives and Special Collections at NYUAD Library.

Coach Peter Dicce reflects on his journey to NYU Abu Dhabi, from practicing law in the United States, to leading the Department of Athletics in NYUAD. He talks about building the department from a few students and informal teams, to getting uniforms, and then later becoming leaders in collegiate sports in the country. A major reason for this success comes from a concerted effort to create and build a community among students, coaches, and administrators, which was achieved through creating traditions and breaking down gender or social barriers. He describes the enjoyable process of creating more friendly competition and interaction through ADISL [Abu Dhabi Inter-University Sports League], as well as creating a logo and mascot for NYUAD, both of which encouraged neighbouring schools to participate. Coach Dicce fondly remembers the origins of many traditions such as the Sports Majlis, the semesterly Falcon Feast, Interclasico, and Defend the Nest.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_37de01cab3520088c0bbdfc220e3f2f9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview session with Aicha Zekar, Eyob Mengiste, Pantelis Demetriou (Engineering Instructors), and Lauren Kata (01:35:25)

Aicha touches on the role of class size in forging closer connections with her students, which is also reflected in the wider community as they observe that there is a close-knit community amongst the instructors across departments, and between them and NYUAD's contracted staff, for example. Eyob and Pantelis describe their experiences in the GAF Program, which provided close communication channels between themselves and students, as well as inter-departmental connections.

Conducted as part of the Memory Project, during a 2021 "Memory Project Week." </p><p>In this session, Nurpeiis and Jonathan talk about their first impressions of NYU Abu Dhabi, what inspired them to start Jagged, the importance of mentorship in their lives, and participation in the StartAD competition. Jagged is an online platform that matches high school students with mentors that are from university. Initially, it started off as a mentorship program in Kazakhstan and Malaysia. Nurpeiis mentions how attending Nazarbayev Intellectual School and completing the IB program shaped his personality, and after coming to NYUAD, he wanted to give back to the community. After his sophomore year, Nurpeiis and his friends, fellow students from Kazakhstan, started an Izbasar mentorship program. Jonathan also shares Nurpeiis' sentiments, and after seeing the success of the mentorship program with 20 paired mentors and mentees in Kazakhstan, they expanded the program to Malaysia and renamed it to Jagged. Together with their friends, Alex Edwards and Dhabia Al Mansoori, the team pitched their idea at StartAD and NYU New York Venture competitions and also received funding from Sandooq Al Watan. Currently they have launched their first app on the App Store and developed a Jagged podcast. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_78d876241b34a4dc04a0b18fcef14d7a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview session with Robert Titus, Norca Vincent (Campus Safety), and Lauren Kata (01:25:28)</unittitle><unitid>ADRG023_039</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/26131</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">24 Mar 2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_3a87e859bfdfadd64f64631cd286359b" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_b7659659d2a9cb220d6a1de98a43b093" parent="aspace_3a87e859bfdfadd64f64631cd286359b" type="folder">ADRG023_039</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_205cc224abb17c173ea5222faf38ca46"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Video-recorded session with Robert Titus, Director of the Department of Public Safety, and Norca Vincent, Assistant Director, recorded on Wednesday, 24  March, 2021 and facilitated by Lauren Kata, Assistant Academic Librarian for Archives and Special Collections at NYUAD Library.

Conducted as part of the Memory Project.</p><p>REACH stands for Raising Empowered Advocates for Community Health, and was founded by Kamel Alsharif, Annalisa Galgano, and Eliza T. in 2015 under the supervision of Tina Wadhwa (Student Success and Well Being). In 2015, Kamel Alsharif, Class of 2017, noticed that there were not enough mental health support services for students (no professional counselors at the Health and Wellness Center), and following the mentality "See something - say something", he started REACH together with his friends. While REACH has an element of SIG (Student Interest Group) to it, such as students having interest in supporting mental health development, it exists outside of the SIG framework. The recruitment process for REACH members has changed and evolved over time, as well as the number of students who want to join REACH. REACH members take up different roles, including but not limited to: The Nook (peer-counseling service), social media (looking over social media accounts), treasurer (managing the budget), leading the group (training students). REACH is unique to NYU Abu Dhabi, and has played an integral role in debunking stereotypes about mental health. REACH also organizes so-called "legacy" events yearly, such as ordering banana pudding or bubble tea for the entire community, and hosting Doggy De-Stress. The nature of the event changes based on the health and safety regulations. Katarina Holtzapple, Class of 2020, also notes how the demographics among the REACH members has evolved over time, with more students from different backgrounds, such as Computer Science, joining the team.  </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_07f9e1ebe6795b2287af377ddff9b686" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview session with Tina Wadhwa, Annalisa Galgano, Liza Tait-Bailey, Nadeen Alalami (REACH), and Lauren Kata (01:28:29)</unittitle><unitid>ADRG023_043</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/26135</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">30 Apr 2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_cb1c2e485a7ea3aa1f855f36e9ffd723" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_9c32be4b8adfd49c00632b91879a6b2e" parent="aspace_cb1c2e485a7ea3aa1f855f36e9ffd723" type="folder">ADRG023_043</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cc36daee3c030396490dd3e9556ab735"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Video-recorded session with Tina Wadhwa, Director of Student Success and Wellbeing, Annalisa Galgano, Liza Tait-Bailey, Nadeen Alalami, former REACH members, recorded on Friday, 30 April, 2021 and facilitated by Lauren Kata, Assistant Academic Librarian for Archives and Special Collections at NYUAD Library.

Annalisa explains how the REACH team wanted the program to have a holistic approach of student mental health and wellbeing, and then in conversation with Liza, discusses the importance of being there for one another and having the vision of starting a program. Then, Tina shares the story of the Mission and Vision activity during the conceptualization phase, and how the students were so engaged and proactive and how that activity impacted the narrative of the program for the future. Later on, everyone explains their perception of REACH's origin story - from the first few meetings and events, peer support activities and sessions, budget difficulties, low outreach, to continual progress and REACH becoming a household name. Then, all of them reflect on their mission to push for change and advocate for different things while supporting peers. Tina touches upon the skills that students acquire: validating, normalizing, refraining; also she discusses the intercept between the Health Promotion Office and REACH. Finally, everyone discusses how the impact of REACH remains with them after graduating, and that they carry REACH values with them throughout life. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_3f36c0e5dbe5ddc492aa5f9617330630" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview session with Abdur Rehman, Dana AlHosani, Rida Zafar, Brian Kim (REACH), and Lauren Kata (57:25)</unittitle><unitid>ADRG023_044</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/26136</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">02 May 2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_3beae3c7a37937bafcf170259baa970e" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_e37f311329c4afb8c8fc9ff633a0779c" parent="aspace_3beae3c7a37937bafcf170259baa970e" type="folder">ADRG023_044</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_addb6cf6799ded61b645f7bbf549629b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Video-recorded Memory Project session with former REACH members Abdur Rehman, Dana AlHosani, Rida Zafar, and Brian Kim, recorded on Sunday, May 2, 2021, and facilitated by Lauren Kata, Assistant Librarian for Archives and Special Collections at NYUAD Library.

He also recalls the emergence of REACH from a limited role in the Health Promotion Office to an integral part of campus life and independent student body. Dana shares why she was intimidated to join REACH initially, but later with the help of Tina Wadhwa (from Health Promotion Office), she practiced role-playing and active listening that earned her a position in the REACH during her senior year. Rida talks about the most impressive programs of REACH; redefining success and anonymous failures in which different success and failure stories beyond academics are shared, and encourages students to look for their own successes and handle failures. Abdur talks about the other works of REACH, such as delivering Safe Alcohol Education, Sexual Misconduct, and Administrative meetings. In between, they also talk about their experience helping people with stress management, hosting Nook sessions (peer counselling) and their attachment with people both in and out of REACH.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_37d74260984e8168e98df27994a5fa0f" level="file"><did><unittitle> Interview session with Wayne Young, Corey Meyer, Ross Jiang and Lauren Kata (Running Session 1) (56:52)</unittitle><unitid>ADRG023_063</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/33550</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021-06-23/2021-06-23">23 June 2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_a265bb841123913e77797aff89e7a112" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_19951f866fb702d0da7640c72e7ae83c" parent="aspace_a265bb841123913e77797aff89e7a112" type="folder">ADRG023_063</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2cc29f44ba3e4292fadbb0d47be693e1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Video-recorded session with former NYUAD Running Community Members - Corey Meyer (Class of 2015) and Ross Jiang (Class of 2020)- including Wayne Young, Director of Wellness recorded on Wednesday, June 23rd, 2021 and facilitated by Lauren Kata, Assistant Academic Librarian for Archives and Special Collections at NYUAD.

She has South Asian Indian heritage but she has spent the majority of her life in Abu Dhabi, UAE, as she grew up there, studying at the American Community School (ACS). The earliest stages of her career were in Toronto, where she worked in the non-profit and public sector, fundraising campaigns, and event management. Later on, she moved back to Abu Dhabi to start a non-profit group connecting community charities and nonprofits with community members, which prompted Ms. Renee Dugan, her supervisor, to hire Suparna at NYU Abu Dhabi, after being formally introduced by the CEO of Aramex. She was very excited for the opportunity, having heard of no similar project in the region. Suparna started out as having an ambassador role, connecting her corporate work with NYUAD's first few initiatives, but through time, this evolved to a full-time position. Throughout the conversation, she explains how NYUAD's recognition was cultivated through dinners, meetings with partners and helping students give back to the community. She highlights the program pillars: working with middle and high school youth (peer mentorship), deepening work with individuals with intellectual and physical disabilities, and working with migrant communities in Abu Dhabi, immersing in the UAE culture and heritage, and lastly, environmental sustainability, all designed at Community Outreach. She ends by highlighting the students' engagement and involvement in creating a greater community. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e4166504de34f79df9a0af959874a82b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview session with Renee Dugan, Suparna Mathur (Community Outreach) and Lauren Kata (01:23:23)</unittitle><unitid>ADRG023_069</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/33553</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021-09-19/2021-09-19">19 Sept 2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_09b2136233fe849f7b309c3225d8b556" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_671c233b361a202261a0d0b0d62efb8a" parent="aspace_09b2136233fe849f7b309c3225d8b556" type="folder">ADRG023_069</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a3ba847fe3b332cefde80d11d30a37e1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Video-recorded session with the members of NYUAD Community Outreach - Renee Dugan, Suparna Mathur, on Sunday, September 19th, 2021 and facilitated by Lauren Kata, Assistant Academic Librarian for Archives and Special Collections at NYUAD.

Regarding her journey to NYU Abu Dhabi — a friend told her that G4S is hiring, and she started in Al Ain, but then got invited to join NYUAD in 2010, and got interviewed by Mr. Robert Titus and Ms. Norca Vincent, getting accepted in the end. She wanted to work at NYUAD because she wanted to become independent and responsible — the support from her family helped her along the way. What she likes about the NYUAD community is that she met wonderful, diverse people, but a challenge has been the separation from her family. Lastly, Fathia reflects on possible plans for the future, which for her are studying in medical school to become a phlebotomist. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2008758fc623fbf3bbf44c6631825e87" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview session with Yasir Ur Rehman and Laura Assanmal (OSR) (22:29)</unittitle><unitid>ADRG023_048</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/33526</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021-06-09/2021-06-09">9 June 2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_d862c9429131c8f191e96e1f88484be3" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_60114546e0fe2f39032a82145f1c71f2" parent="aspace_d862c9429131c8f191e96e1f88484be3" type="folder">ADRG023_048</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_24fc698083e85ca49a3fc72a1544ee6c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Audio-recorded Memory Project session with Yasir Ur Rehman, Control Room Operator in Public Safety Department, recorded on the 9th of June, 2021, and facilitated by Laura Assanmal, a PPTP student for the Office of Social Responsibility and conducted as part of OSR's 10-year project and The Memory Project.

She was able to take an English course which is offered by the Office of Social Responsibility.

She starts by saying that she was born and lived close to Manila, Philippines. She speaks Tagalog and English. While in the Philippines, she graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, and she worked there for about six years, in accounting for a newspaper company rather than her field. Then, a friend told her about a great opportunity for work at G4S in the UAE. Madel was interested in the idea and decided to apply to work for G4S in NYUAD. Throughout the years, she managed to transform her role from a Control Room Operator to a Control Room Supervisor, spanning her career at NYUAD to 11 years and counting. What she especially likes about the working environment there is that even security guards are taken care of, and made to feel comfortable. Madel was a part of the DTC Campus as well, in Sama Tower, and she draws a comparison between the two campuses, saying that Saadiyat is bigger and it's harder to get to know everyone. Then, she reflects on her relationship with her daughter and opens up about a difficult life event with her mother. Madel has taken English and Financial Literacy courses, and Computer classes. She shares some memorable events at NYUAD like Iftar and Staff Appreciation Week and hopes to perhaps move to Canada with her daughter in the future. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_3d166003deb18578ecfa4ed5aef580aa" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interview session with Bakht Munir Khan and Laura Assanmal (OSR) (10:08)</unittitle><unitid>ADRG023_066</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/33547</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021-06-10/2021-06-10">10 June 2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_5655a0ba2acdbe21c977931f9de981d6" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">Electronic Records</container><container id="aspace_a45dc17b0fccd4c0347559315cce45cd" parent="aspace_5655a0ba2acdbe21c977931f9de981d6" type="folder">ADRG023_066</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4a0f24a65528973cbcb5e90260f2653e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Audio-recorded session with Bakht Munir Khan, Security Officer at Public Safety, and facilitated by Laura Assanmal, PPTP student.

He works as a driver at the transport department of NYUAD. He has worked for 35 years of his life - spending 10 years in Saudi Arabia as a trailer driver, then in Dubai and Sharjah before moving to a position at NYUAD in 2011 through Global Wings. What made him change different job positions was usually the low salary. He came to the UAE in 1999. He is very thankful to NYUAD for giving him opportunities he never could have imagined - one of which is giving his children quality education. He is proud to say that one son is working in Dubai while the other studies medicine in the Philippines, at a U.S. university. With the help of the NYUAD salary, he was able to build a home back in India. He finished Business English 1 and 2 courses with the Office of Social Responsibility. Some of his dreams for the future are for his youngest son to finish his education and for his eldest to get a job at NYUAD.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_eb8af74a060a0d2122805a5eee97edd8" level="series"><did><unittitle>Interviews with NYUAD Community Members [post-Covid]</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/33522</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2022-11/2026-02" type="inclusive">Fall 2022 - Present</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b3f069af69b4a029a914057e711cc886"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series of interviews includes interviews conducted after the easing of restrictions due to Covid (after summer 2022).
