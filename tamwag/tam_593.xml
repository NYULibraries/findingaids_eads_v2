    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Vera Rony (1918-2011) was an educator; writer; and labor, union, and civil rights advocate. </p><p>Rony was born in Hungary in 1918. After coming to America in the 1920s, her father, Hugo Rony, became a medical doctor and her mother, Pauline (also known as Palko), took care of the household. Rony received her bachelor's degree from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1940, and her master's degree from the University of Chicago in 1969.</p><p>In 1952, she began her career at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU), where she founded the education department of the Beltmakers Union and instituted night classes, a library, and a political action program. From 1956-1964, she was the executive director of the Workers Defense League (WDL), a workers' rights organization founded in 1936; her accomplishments included the organization of a training program to prepare minority youth to enter the building trades and a co-written report on how racism was used in the South to thwart union organizing efforts. </p><p>Additionally, from 1965-1969, Rony participated in the civil rights movement in the South, publishing a number of articles on the relationships between unions and civil rights. Also around this time, she worked with various organizations, including the Congress of Racial Equity (CORE), Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC), the Middle Tennessee Labor Conference, and the Southern Tenants Farmer Union (STFU). She most likely did not hold paid positions with these organizations, but worked as a volunteer consultant, committee member, and/or editor/contributor for publications. At the Rural Advancement Fund (part of the National Sharecroppers Fund/NSF), she chaired the Education Committee for the Frank P. Graham Rural Training Center in Wadesboro, North Carolina.</p><p>Rony began her career at SUNY Stony Brook in 1969, as the first assistant vice president of the affirmative action program. By 1978, she had founded the Labor Management Studies Program, where she served as the director until 1987. Rony also held a visiting scholar position at Georgia State University, from 1976-1978. She was the Executive Producer of <emph render='italic'>The Uprising of '34</emph>, a 1995 PBS documentary that explores the 1934 General Textile Strike in which 500,000 Southern mill laborers walked off their jobs. In 1995, the documentary won the Oral History Association Award for Nonprint Media for George Stoney and Judith Helfand, co-directors and co-producers, and Vera Rony, executive producer. Rony died on June 2, 2011, after a brief struggle with lymphoma. </p>  </bioghist>

<p>At the time of accessioning, materials were rehoused in archival boxes, with loose material placed into folders in their original order. Materials were described on the collection-level with a box-level inventory. </p><p>At the time of processing, the collection was arranged and described into series and subseries based on the original order and the types of materials. Routine medical and financial statements, duplicate publications and documents (including one on a floppy disk), publications available online, and documents with sensitive personal information were removed. Two floppy disks were forensically imaged and analyzed. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Vera Rony Papers (1865-2009) consist of materials created and collected by Rony documenting her life as, in her own words, a "participant observer," or someone who alternates between the worlds of academia and grassroots fieldwork. The bulk of the collection relates to her work with different labor organizations, the making of the film, and her writing, all of which are closely related because of her focus on the history of labor movements in the South. She spent many years researching and writing on the topic, beginning in the 1960s, which seemed to culminate in the film and a never-published book, "True South." The collection contains news clippings, publications, printed ephemera, correspondence, and research files related to Rony's work at Stony Brook, the Workers Defense League (WDL), National Sharecroppers Fund (NSF), and other groups; Rony's published and unpublished writings; research, publicity, and administrative files for <emph render='italic'>The Uprising of '34</emph>; VHS tapes and audiocassettes of interviews, mostly related to the film; and personal correspondence and photographs. </p><p>This collection documents the history of labor, unions, and civil rights movements in the United States, particularly in the South, in the 1950s-1970s. The collection is especially relevant to researchers interested in the activities of organizations such as the WDL and NSF, the agricultural and textile industries, racism, poverty, and the development and curricula of labor management studies programs.</p>  </scopecontent>

Her work with WDL, NSF, and STFU, among others, reflects her expertise in the Southern labor movement and labor history in general. Her interest in civil rights, especially those related to labor and unions, is reflected in the materials from the SSOC, where she possibly worked as a seminar speaker, and the correspondence files, in which she corresponded with the various publishers about the series of articles that she wrote in the mid-late 1960s. Her success in creating an academic program of study on labor is reflected in her career at SUNY Stony Brook, where she instituted the affirmative action program, founded the Center for Labor/Management Studies, and taught. Materials in this series include correspondence; meeting minutes and agendas; memos; publications (newsletters, press releases, and reports) from the organizations; reappointment materials for her position at Stony Brook; a report on the Labor/Management Studies program; and syllabi and lecture notes for Stony Brook and Georgia State University. In addition, there is a file on Rony's conference and event talks and speeches, which includes an audio recording of her participation in "Women, Work, and Dollars," in 1980.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_272995efe49265c0daa7222692bb0a57" level="file"><did><unittitle>Curriculum Vitae</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/965364</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1955/1998" type="inclusive">1955-1998</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

This series reflects her lifelong passion for labor history, especially the Southern textile industry. Rony began interviewing people in the 1960s, most likely while she was writing about the civil rights movement, and continued gathering interview and research material through the 1990s. She also organized a research consortium in 1984-1985, in order to interview survivors of the strike which led to the making of a short film. This film helped her to persuade George Stoney, a NYU filmmaker, to direct the documentary. Materials include correspondence with the members of the consortium and Stoney, Consortium meeting minutes, transcripts and audiocassettes of interviews, various notes (both handwritten and typed), publicity materials (such as reviews and flyers), financial documents (budgets, fundraising efforts, and grant applications), research materials (including videocassettes and newsreels on the strike), drafts of the script, videocassettes of the film (including promotional videos, samplers, and rough cuts), and a study guide for schools, which was generated after the release of the film in 1995.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_a3ecf5cef22976e4a7b0884f9816f5a6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Early Notes and Proposal for Publication on the Uprising of 1934</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/965407</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1968/1968">1968</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

She published various articles on civil rights and unions in the mid-late 1960s. These articles covered topics such as union organization at J. P. Stevens, the conflict between the civil rights movement and the paper workers union in Bogalusa, Louisiana; poverty and unions; the Mississippi "tent city" strike of 1966; and the changes in the civil rights and labor movements in the South. Related drafts, notes, and research materials are included here. Additionally, she published a companion piece to <emph render='italic'>The Uprising of '34</emph> in <emph render='italic'>The South Carolina Review</emph> in 1994-1995. Rony wrote a number of articles on labor that were unpublished; many of these articles were presumably used for her book, "True South," a passion project which she worked on from the 1970s through her death in 2011. The book's focus was on the history of Southern "uplanders," or descendants of Scotch and Irish pioneers in the Piedmont region (Southern Virginia, East Tennessee, the Carolinas, and Northern Georgia and Alabama), and industrial development. Rony experimented with different titles for the book, including "The Roots of the Anti-Union South: A History of the Southern Textile Workers" and "The Roots of the Anti-Union South," before settling on "True South." A significant part of this collection consists of drafts, notes, manuscripts, correspondence with editors and readers, and research for this work.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_1e0084f6407c63569d65b6514734aa92" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries IV.A Published</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/965494</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1961/1995" type="inclusive">1961-1995</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4e91d56cba233441b1653b34215b34ba"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This subseries contains drafts, notes, research material, and correspondence with publishers and readers for Rony's published articles (1960s-late 1990s), and the report that she co-wrote for WDL, on racism in Southern Labor relations.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_57923aff2bf7383cfbdd1265e469fec3" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render='italic'>Racism in Southern Labor Relations</emph> Draft, with John Schulter, for WDL</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/965495</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1962/1962">1962</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
