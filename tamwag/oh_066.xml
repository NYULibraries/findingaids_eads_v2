    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Tamar Carroll is a history professor at Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York.  Between 2003 and 2005, while a PhD candidate in history at the University of Michigan, Carroll conducted oral histories with members of Women's Health Action and Mobilization (WHAM!) for her dissertation.  Her dissertation, "Women's Activism, Identity Politics, and Social Change in NYC, 1955-1995", focused on three social movements in New York City between the 1950s and 1990s.  One of the movements was the partnership between the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) and WHAM! to improve health care, fight homophobia and misogyny, and to support People with AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s.  These interviews were also used as the basis for her book <emph render="italic">Mobilizing New York: AIDS, Antipoverty, and Feminist Activism</emph> (UNC Press, 2015).</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Tamar Carroll Oral Histories on Women's Health Action and Mobilization (WHAM!) document Carroll's work conducting oral histories with members of WHAM! between 2003 and 2005 as part of her dissertation project.  The collection consists of audio recordings of individual interviews, and video recordings of group interviews and a WHAM! reunion.  Transcripts for some audio interviews are available by request and one interview is available in transcript form only.  The oral histories document the experiences of former members of WHAM!, the work of the organization, and the impact these experiences had on the members.  The individual interviews and the group interview focus on what brought people to WHAM!, the ways in which they participated in the group, the aims of WHAM!, direct actions and protests in which the narrators participated, and coalitions formed between WHAM! and other organizations, in particular the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) and the Reproductive Rights Coalition.  The video recording of the WHAM! reunion documents an event held at the Tamiment Library &amp; Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University in 2005.  The event included a panel of former WHAM! members, each of whom discusses the topics included in the oral history interviews; an overview of her project by Carroll; and discussion with the audience, most of whom were members of WHAM!.</p>  </scopecontent>

The interview was recorded in a crowded location and is often hard to understand, as there is a lot of background noise.  The interview covers Diane Curtis's membership and participation in the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) and the Women's Health Action and Mobilization (WHAM!).  Curtis discusses her introduction to activism in the early 1980s when she came out as a lesbian and became involved in gay rights issues, first in California and then after her move to New York City (NYC) in 1985, and the way in which ACT UP's use of the Silence=Death posters led her to join the organization.  She discusses the way in which the <emph render="italic">Webster v. Reproductive Health Services</emph> Supreme Court decision in 1989 crystallized for her how abortion rights were not safe and that this decision led her to join the Reproductive Rights Coalition (RRC).  She discusses the differences between members of the RRC who belonged to more conservative organizations and younger members coming from ACT UP, and how this led to the creation of WHAM!.  She explains the way WHAM! meetings worked, the fact that they used Robert's Rules of Order to run the meetings, and the ways in which this made it difficult for people to hijack meetings and made it easier for more shy people to participate.  Other topics include WHAM! agendas apart from abortion access, the similarities between ACT UP and WHAM!, and the way in which WHAM! affected the later careers of its members, including Curtis.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref22" level="file"><did><unittitle>Davis, Susan</unittitle><unitid>cuid34421</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2004-03-03/2004-03-03">2004-03-03</unitdate><container altrender="Card Box 5.75" id="aspace_4fc3fd7a5cf946fe90bb4d8ff42db99b" label="Audio [31142062671543]" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_d08d52f934d0d75b95f18c2f0b23f3b4" parent="aspace_4fc3fd7a5cf946fe90bb4d8ff42db99b" type="CD">TW_OH_066_1</container><dao xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:href="https://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/material-request-placeholder" xlink:role="electronic-records-reading-room" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Davis, Susan" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Davis, Susan: 2004-03-03-</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_9314ad42406e0af0d5d9e0c6c8a583f0"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Susan Davis was born in Rochester, New York and was raised by her mother.

Morgan discusses the ways in which WHAM! aimed to have a new activist identity for a younger generation of women's reproductive health activists and WHAM!'s focus on eye-catching demonstrations that used activists's bodies as sites of protest, at times causing arrest.

The interview largely focuses on Karen Ramspacher's work as a reproductive rights activist in New York City from 1988 to 1994. Ramspacher's interview revolves around her time as a member of Women's Health Action and Mobilization (WHAM!), as well as her association with other New York-based activist groups such as AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power (ACT UP), Church Ladies For Choice, Community Health Project, National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL), Reproductive Rights Coalition (RRC), and Treatment Action Group (TAG). She discusses beginning her involvement in activist movements shortly after graduating college in 1987, joining ACT UP, and participating in their meetings and actions over the next several years. She explains how inspired by the direct action techniques of ACT UP, she joined the RRC and subsequently became a member of WHAM! in 1989. Ramspacher recounts participating in clinic escorting and defending, but explains that her main focus with WHAM! was organizing public protests and advocating for and performing self-help gynecology. She discusses how her participation in direct activism lessened after 1993, when her time shifted to providing direct care for friends with AIDS.  Topics discussed in detail include New York's activist environment in the 1980s and 1990s; social, gender, and generational dynamics within WHAM!; WHAM! actions and organizational structure; and the role of radical politics in activist groups and society.  </p><p>An electronic transcript of this interview is also available by request.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref16" level="file"><did><unittitle>Shaw, Susan</unittitle><unitid>cuid34420</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2004-07-26/2004-07-26">2004-07-26</unitdate><container altrender="CD Box - 6  x 15" id="aspace_9263604beff5b2838b0e8e86334ffb91" label="Audio [31142062758951]" type="Box">Shared Tamiment 091</container><container id="aspace_4064f3c2e7f11f195974aee224bbf435" parent="aspace_9263604beff5b2838b0e8e86334ffb91" type="CD">OH-66-007-01</container><container altrender="Card Box 5.75" id="aspace_75ba3d4eecab5f8f7134b028868336e1" label="Audio [31142062671543]" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_776231721f741820646b13acd93d4199" parent="aspace_75ba3d4eecab5f8f7134b028868336e1" type="CD">TW_OH_066_3</container><dao xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:href="https://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/material-request-placeholder" xlink:role="electronic-records-reading-room" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Shaw, Susan" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Shaw, Susan: 2004-07-26-</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_c9bd1449e288d35ff84c4571f293516a"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Susan Shaw is a former member of Women's Health Action and Mobilization (WHAM!) and the People with AIDS Coalition.

Shaw describes the way in which she became interested in activism, beginning in high school during Ronald Reagan's presidency and her focus on the United States' involvement in Central America and the movement to end apartheid in South Africa.  She describes her introduction to WHAM! in 1991 or 1992, after she finished college and moved to New York City.  She relates the excitement she felt at the way WHAM! was focusing on different issues of women's health, particularly because she was not interested in the clinic defense movement and was glad to have other topics to focus on, in particular sterilization abuses, women with AIDS, and health issues faced by women of color.  She discusses the fact that WHAM! was mainly white, college-educated people, many of whom were lesbians, that they wanted to form coalitions with groups that reflected them but Shaw wanted to broaden the coalitions to groups of different races and classes.  She also discusses her work on the New Member Packet for WHAM!, in the interest of making the organization easier for people to join and understand.

Reunion was recorded on video on October 15, 2005.  The event is opened by former head of Tamiment Michael H. Nash who discusses the relationship between Tamiment and WHAM!, Carroll's dissertation project, and the work of the Tamiment Library.  Levin shares a slideshow of images from WHAM! events and direct actions.  Carroll discusses her dissertation topic and her relationship with the former members of WHAM! with whom she conducted oral histories.  The bulk of the reunion focuses on the presentations of Staniszewski, Tepper, Cole, Wolf, and Levin who each discuss how they became active in WHAM! and the importance of WHAM!'s work.  They focus on what made WHAM! special; the coalitions WHAM! formed with other activist groups, especially ACT-UP and the Reproductive Rights Coalition; and the ways in which WHAM! impacted each of them individually.  The remainder of the recording includes people from the audience sharing their experiences with WHAM!.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref30" level="file"><did><unittitle>WHAM!
