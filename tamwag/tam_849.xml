    <abstract id="aspace_d12545abef7173f3e1fceab37db33203">William Turbin (1909-2005) ran dances at the Rand School Auditorium in the 1930s, hiring big bands to play the events and circulating advertisements in local publications. He was born on the Lower East Side in 1909 to Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. After graduating from Seward Park High School (1927), he worked as an appliance salesman for Consolidated Edison. In the evening he ran dances, an inexpensive form of entertainment for working women and men. At a Rand School dance he met Ruth Fiedler, a Bronx-born daughter of Polish Jewish immigrants. They married in 1939. During World War II he termed his dances Danceens, after USO Canteens, for servicemen on leave. After the War, he continued at Con Edison as a meter tester (anti-monopoly legislation forced the company to move away from the appliance business). The William Turbin Collection on the Rand School Auditorium Dances (dated 1938-1939) consists of newspaper clippings, advertisements, and ephemera documenting social events (primarily dances) held at the Rand School of Social Science. These materials document the Rand School not just as a site of political education for workers and the working class, but also the role it played as a social outlet and space of community-gathering.</abstract>

<p>William Turbin (1909-2005) ran dances at the Rand School Auditorium in the 1930s, hiring big bands to play the events and circulating advertisements in local publications. He was born on the Lower East Side in 1909 to Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. After graduating from Seward Park High School (1927), he worked as an appliance salesman for Consolidated Edison. In the evening he ran dances, an inexpensive form of entertainment for working women and men. At a Rand School dance he met Ruth Fiedler, a Bronx-born daughter of Polish Jewish immigrants. They married in 1939. During World War II he termed his dances Danceens, after USO Canteens, for servicemen on leave. After the War, he continued at Con Edison as a meter tester (anti-monopoly legislation forced the company to move away from the appliance business). He retired in 1965 and developed his new sideline, wholesaling New York City souvenirs, bronze-plated Statues of Liberty and Empire State Buildings, into a full-time business. In 1975 he sold the business, worked as a salesman for new owners, and learned magic, performing at libraries and hospitals. He continued this until his death at 96 in 2005.</p>  </bioghist>
