In the course of their activities, the CPP posted bail for Sundiata Acoli (one of the Panther 21), and addressed Congress in 1972 about the right to privacy, the dangers of misused technology, and the potential harms misused computer technology can cause to society. The group authored an Electronic Bill of Rights, and published a newsletter called <emph render="italic">Interrupt</emph>. CPP was also amongst the groups in 1971 who formed a lawsuit against the NYPD's surveillance of private citizens.Joan Greenbaum is a Professor Emerita at the CUNY Graduate Center, an author, activist, computer programmer and technologist, and political economist. She is a member of the executive board of the Professional Staff Congress (PSC), a cooperative member of Three Arrows, and was a research fellow at NYU's AI Now. In the 1960s and 1970s, Greenbaum was founder of and activist with Computer People for Peace. Julie Millstein served as the CPP Corresponding Secretary and Paul Millstein served in leadership capacities for the organization. The Joan Greenbaum, Julie Millstein, and Paul Millstein Collection on Computer People for Peace (dated 1968-1978) consists of materials documenting the philosophies and activities of Computer People for Peace (CPP). Materials include correspondence, photographs, ephemera, a complete set of the group's newsletter <emph render="italic">Interrupt</emph>, and issues of <emph render="italic">Datamation</emph> that feature CPP. The collection documents CPP's organizing efforts against American involvement in the Vietnam War, as well as broader campaigns about intersections of technology, privacy, surveillance, corporate racism, and unemployment as a result of automation. The collection also documents mid- and late-20th century efforts to create a responsible and equitable technology industry.</abstract>
