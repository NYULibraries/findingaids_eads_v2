    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Guantánamo Bay Detention Camp was opened in 2002 in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 to detain suspected terrorists and "enemy combatants" by the Bush administration. Due to the nature of Guantánamo not being on American territory, detainees were held by the American government without charges or trial and subject to human rights violations and abuse. Legal organizations, protestors, politicians, and international bodies have called for the closure of Guantánamo Bay Detention Camp and worked to release detainees. As of this writing (January 2025), Guantánamo is still open and 15 detainees remain.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>In 2010, a finding aid was created for the Web Archiving Service (WAS) Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp Web Archive in Archivists' Toolkit as TAM 506. In 2014, the archived websites in the Guantánamo Bay Detention Camp and War Crimes collection in WAS/Archive-It were added as part the Tamiment Library Web Collection on Organizations (WEB ARC 003). In 2025, the websites associated with this Archive-It collection were intellectually transferred into its own collection, Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Web Collection on Guantánamo Bay Detention Camp and War Crimes (TAM 845).</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Custodial History</head>
<p>Tamiment Library, New York University began web archiving in 2007 as part of a grant given by the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) of the Library of Congress. Websites were initially selected by Tamiment Library curators and captured through the use of the California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service in 2007 as part of the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp &amp; War Crimes (U.S.) Web Archive. In November 2015, these websites were migrated to Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. The accession number associated with the initial set of archived websites is 2009.050. For archived websites captured after 2018, the accession numbers associated with these websites are 2019.090, 2019.129, 2022.038, 2024.001, and 2025.014.</p>  </custodhist>

The group organized nonviolent direct actions, such as hunger strikes, demonstration, and other acts of civil disobedience. Annually, on January 11, they hold events and vigils to mark the anniversary of the first prisoners brought to Guantánamo Bay in 2002. In 2008, the 100 Days Campaign was a campaign organized by Witness Against Torture to close the Guantánamo Bay Detention Camp and end torture and rendition by the United States within the first 100 days of the Obama administration, mostly focusing on Uighur detainees and the expansion of the Bagram Theatre Internment Facility. The group held daily vigils outside of the White House and met with United States representatives. </p><p>The January 11 Day of Action Against Guantánamo was an action organized by Witness Against Torture, marking the 10th anniversary of the opening of Guantánamo Bay Detention Camp in 2012. During the two-week hunger strike associated with the action, five activists were also on trial for unlawful conduct related to speaking out against an "appropriations bill containing a measure to strip funding from any efforts to repatriate Guantánamo detainees" in the House of Representatives.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_8efa51a98c85cc92c4555867b8476c81"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The websites contain information on the annual January 11 actions, their campaign calling the Obama administration to close Guantánamo during the first 100 days of his presidency, photos from the actions and at visits to Cuba, biographies of detainees, detainee letters, activist testimonies, book and film resources, and news and press releases related to Guantánamo Bay and Bagram Detention facilities.</p></scopecontent></c></dsc>
