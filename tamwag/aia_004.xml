    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Materials were placed in new acid-free folders and boxes. Subsequent additions to the collection have been interfiled into existing alphabetical arrangement scheme. Box numbering is not necessarily sequential because of multiple accretions to the collection.</p><p>In the winter of 2022, approximately 34.27 linear feet of additional newspapers and periodicals were processed, arranged, and added to this collection by an archivist. The finding aid was edited to reflect this addition of materials. The finding aid was also reformatted, making the dates and publications easier to navigate. </p><p>In September 2024, items from box 158 were rehoused into appropriately sized flat boxes, resulting in the deletion of box 158.</p><p>In February 2025, issues of <emph render="italic">The Recorder</emph> were appraised out of the John and Ann Garvey Papers (AIA 088), rehoused in archival folders and boxes (Shared Tamiment 188 and 189), and intellectually integrated into the collection's existing arrangement. In May 2025, issues of multiple publications were rehoused in Boxes 240-248, and intellectually integrated into the collection's existing arrangement. Duplicates of issues already in the collection holdings were appraised out of the accession.</p><p>In May 2025, materials from Box 163 were rehoused into three manuscript boxes. These are boxes 163, 249, and 250. Folders in boxes 249 and 250 were renumbered. The finding aid was updated to reflect these changes. </p><p>In December 2025, materials from Box 162 were rehoused into three manuscript boxes. Materials are now found in Boxes 162, 251, and 252. Folders in boxes 251 and 252 were renumbered. The finding aid was updated to reflect these changes.</p><p>In January 2026, an accretion of issues of the <emph render="italic">Irish Literary Supplement</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Irish Echo</emph> from 2024-2025 were rehoused in archival boxes and folders and intellectually integrated into the collection's existing alphabetical arrangement.</p>  </processinfo>
