DSA promotes a socialist conception of democracy, with a key objective being the coalition-building of progressive groups in the United States.

The collection consists of 69 tapes, spanning the years 1976 - 1996, with the bulk of the items falling between the years 1985-1995. The majority of the audiocassettes consist of conference, convention and meeting recordings of the DSA, interviews and speeches of Michael Harrington, and programs and lectures that were either sponsored by, or featured members of, DSA.</abstract>

    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) was formed in 1982 after a merger of the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) and the New American Movement (NAM). DSOC was formed in 1973 by a split in the Social Democrats USA; NAM was organized in 1971 by New Leftists. As a unified group, the DSA's ideology is based on a socialist conception of democracy. A key objective is to build a coalition of the major progressive forces in the United States, including trade unions, women's groups and minority organizations. Its tactics include grass-roots activity, working within existing mainstream institutions, and electoral politics within the left wing of the Democratic Party. The DSA is the U.S. affiliate to the Socialist International. </p><p>The structure of the DSA parallels that of the former DSOC. The decision-making bodies of the DSA consist of: the National Convention, which meets biennially; the National Board (NB), which meets between National Conventions and has the authority to charter local and regional organizations; the National Executive Committee (NEC), which meets between the National Boards and National conventions; and the National Interim Committee (NIC), a subcommittee of the NEC which meets between meetings of the NEC and is responsible for the supervision of all offices and staff of the organization. The National Board charters a Youth Section for full-time students age 30 and younger, which has its own locals and structured organization. The NB or the NEC can charter commissions. Members of the NEC serve as liaisons to the commissions and locals and can appoint committees (such as the NIC). Local and regional organizations, chartered by the NEC, carry out independent activities throughout the country. </p><p>Michael Harrington (1928-1989) was a U.S. socialist, editor, writer, founder and leader of DSA, and political leader best known for his book <title>The Other America: Poverty in the United States</title> 1962).</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The collection consists of 69 tapes, spanning the years 1976 - 1996, with the bulk of the items falling between 1985 - 1995. The majority of the audiocassettes consist of conference, convention and meeting recordings of the DSA, interviews and speeches of Michael Harrington, and programs and lectures that were either sponsored by, or featured members of, DSA. Many of the recordings feature or refer to DSA Co-Chairs Michael Harrington and Barbara Ehrenreich. </p><p>The collection has been divided into four subgroups: DSOC, DSA, Michael Harrington, and Miscellaneous. Subgroup One (DSOC) contains a recording of a rally sponsored by the Democratic Agenda Project, which was a joint venture between the DSOC and various progressive groups. Subgroup Two (DSA) contains organizational recordings of DSA, including conferences, meetings and sponsored programs. Subgroup Three (Michael Harrington) contains interviews, speeches and debates featuring Michael Harrington, some of which predate the founding of DSA (1982). Subgroup Four contains miscellaneous audiocassettes, some of which feature DSA members, but the majority whose contents or relationship to DSA are unidentified. </p><p>Conference recordings added to the collection in 2017 include 19 audiocassettes and a conference schedule from the  the 1980 Institute for Democratic Socialism Conference "Eurosocialism and America: An International Exchange". </p>  </scopecontent>
