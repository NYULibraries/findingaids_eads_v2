    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In 1966, Betty Friedan founded the National Organization for Women (NOW) in Washington, D.C., a group whose goal was to "bring women into the mainstream of American society." A year later in 1967, the New York Chapter (NOW-NYC) was founded. NOW-NYC's first four presidents were Jean Faust, Ti-Grace Atkinson, Ivy Bottini, and Jacqueline Ceballos. Early organizing efforts for NOW-NYC were largely related to employment discrimination in hiring practices; and wage discrepancies between men and women. One of NOW-NYC's early victories was the elimination of sex-segregated help-wanted advertisements in the <title render="italic" type="simple">New York Times</title>. From its inception, the group was focused on several issues and functioned through a committee structure that included committees on the arts; child care and family relations; education and employment; the image of women in the media; legislation and politics; reproductive rights; and sexuality.</p><p>Over the years, NOW-NYC organized major demonstrations and strikes, most notably the "Women Strike for Equality March" held in New York City on August 26, 1970, which became an annual tradition for the organization for several years. In its early days, NOW-NYC often used attention-grabbing tactics to amplify its visibility despite its modest size—for example, staging a "flush-in" outside Colgate-Palmolive's offices to protest discriminatory hiring practices. Alongside these creative protests, NOW-NYC also employed more conventional democratic strategies such as lobbying legislators, gathering petitions, and sending mass mailings to the White House in an attempt to influence government policy. NOW-NYC later joined NOW-New York State (NOW-NYS) in hosting an annual state lobbying day; and during the 1980s, the organization established the WomanPower PAC, a political action committee dedicated to raising funds to help elect women and feminist candidates to public office. </p><p>During the 1970s, NOW-NYC's Education Committee examined course selections available to girls and boys in New York Public School and the committee's findings, "Report on Sex Bias in the Public Schools," prompted curriculum changes in schools nationwide. By the mid-1970s, NOW-NYC established one of the first Rape Prevention Committees that focused on issues related to sexual violence against women. This committee provided a range of services to survivors of rape and battery, while also helping to shift public attitudes toward these crimes and their victims. In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, NOW-NYC expanded its employment initiatives to include career-training workshops and job referral programs for both employees and employers</p><p>In the early 1970s, as the campaign to pass the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) began and gathered significant momentum throughout the decade, particularly in the years leading up to the ratification deadline, the ERA became a primary focus for NOW-NYC. NOW-NYC's ERA Task Force collaborated with activists in other states to support ratification efforts in state legislatures. In addition to its political advocacy, NOW-NYC's Image Committee worked to promote fair and respectful portrayals of women in the arts and media. This committee played a role in influencing changes to print advertising, while the Arts Committee highlighted gender discrimination within the art world. </p><p>As of 2025, NOW-NYC continues its mission to advance equality for women in New York City. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>In 2015, two boxes of photographs, negatives, artifacts, and graphic materials were discovered in the repository. The photographs and negatives were added to Series VIII: Photographs, Negatives, and Slides. That same year, artifacts and graphic materials found in the repository were incorporated into Series IX: Artifacts, Ephemera, and Graphic Materials.</p><p>In 2016, a donation from NOW-NYC including executive board meetings were incorporated into Series I: Administration and legal briefs from the same donation were added as a new series, Series XII: Legal Cases.</p><p>In 2017, additional materials were found in the repository. These materials had been separated from the original collection during processing and were reincorporated into the collection in 2017.</p><p>In 2018, five boxes containing banners, videos, photographs, and memorabilia were added to Series XIV: Unprocessed Materials as a 2018 Accretion. These items were originally stored loosely across several boxes and were transferred into proper archival containers. Loose photographs and documents were organized into folders by the archivist, with titles assigned according to general subject matter. The born-digital records included in this accretion were inventoried, but not forensically imaged at this time. </p><p>NOW-NYC sent an additional donation of legal briefs and executive board meetings minutes in 2016. The accession number associated with this gift is 2016.042. In 2018, the organization sent five boxes of photographs, videos, and memorabilia. The accession number associated with this gift is 2018.019. In July 2023, NOW-NYC sent additional administrative documents and ephemera. The accession number associated with this gift is 2023.097. In October 2025, NOW-NYC donated nine digital legal files. The accession number associated with this gift is 2025.082.</p><p>In 2022, additional websites were added to the collection and description for the archived websites was updated. In November 2023, an accretion of administrative documents and ephemera was intellectually integrated into the collection as Boxes 103-106. In April 2025, materials from Box 37 were rehoused into three flat boxes and four folders in a shared flat box. Materials from this box are now found in Boxes 37, 107-108, and Shared Tamiment 194 (Folders 3-6).</p><p>In Fall 2025, an accretion consisting of 44 record cartons, three flat-file-folders, two tall manuscript boxes, two half manuscript boxes, twelve  oversized flat boxes, and a card box was arranged and described by an archivist. All materials housed in record cartons, tall manuscript boxes, and half manuscript boxes were rehoused into legal manuscript boxes. These materials were placed into legal archival folders. Oversized materials were rehoused into appropriately sized archival folders and oversized flat boxes. Original titles, if applicable, were retained, but in some instances, new titles were assigned to better reflect the folder's contents. </p><p>Materials were arranged into series and subseries by topic and then organized predominately alphabetically by file title within those series and subseries – the exception to this arrangement is Series II: Correspondence and Series VI: National and Regional NOW. Related materials were grouped together intellectually and physically, when possible. At this time, naming inconsistencies across the collection were standardized. Duplicate materials and materials that did not fit within the scope of the collection were returned to the donor.</p><p>Photographs were removed from their original housing and placed into archival sleeves.  42 analog audiovisual materials  were assigned individual unique identifying numbers and housed appropriately.</p><p>New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content. During processing, 19 optical disks, two floppy disks, and a compact flash card were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged  using Isobusters and Forensics Toolkit. The electronic records were intellectually incorporated into the finding aid.</p>  </processinfo>

Materials in this subseries date from the late 1960s and early 1970s, at the inception of the women's movement, and are not limited to NOW. The bulk of her papers include position papers on various topics such as pregnancy, abortion, and sexuality; material on other women's liberation groups, such as Red Stockings and Women's Liberation; and correspondence and poetry.

Between 1971-1975, the committee was known as the Reproduction and Its Control Committee and in 1976, the committee changed its name to the Reproductive Rights Committee. This committee worked to repeal all abortion-related laws and make contraception widely available. Beginning in 1971, this committee began working with larger coalitions that formed to fight and repeal restrictive abortion legislation such as the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC).

These programs range from the broad multi-issue "Women Strike for Equality March" (1971) to the narrower-focused "Endowed Chair" project (1973-1976), through which NOW named its conference room chairs after renowned women in history.  This series contains conference and convention materials including information packets, agendas, and programs; invitations, programs, budgets, correspondence, and agendas related to the Women of Power Influence Awards; postcards related to the Women's History Series; and invitations, programs, budgets, correspondence, and agendas related to the Susan B.

Legal cases in this series fall into several categories: (1) those where NOW-NYC was directly involved as a plaintiff, as seen in NOW-NYC v. the Department of Defense, et al. and NOW-NYC v. the New York City Police Department; (2) those where NOW-NYC served as a third-party representative for plaintiffs, as seen in  NOW v. Pataki and NOW v. Cuomo; (3) those where NOW-NYC provided assistance to plaintiffs, as seen in Rosario v. National Bank of Pakistan and Walmart v. Dukes; and (4) high profile legal cases that NOW-NYC was not directly involved with, but large volumes of flyers, memorandum, correspondence, and press within NOW-NYC was generated supporting the plaintiffs of the case,  as seen with Neustein v. Orbach, et al. and Weeks v. Southern Bell Telephone Company. Materials include briefs, plaintiff declarations, memoranda, affirmations, testimony, reports, appeal petitions, press releases, and general correspondence not protected by attorney-client privilege.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_7dc117e207b814802970d738ab671e7a"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Materials in this series are listed in alphabetical order by case title.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_461197faeb832f53a25cc65a88a06a40" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abortion Rights Mobilization (ARM) v. the IRS and Catholic Church</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/1044841</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1980/1980">1980</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_20402ef56e77ba35da2b4dfeffcadb73" label="Mixed Materials [31142054919165]" type="Box">145</container><container id="aspace_4691685820503e14975698cf69af85b1" parent="aspace_20402ef56e77ba35da2b4dfeffcadb73" type="Folder">17</container></did></c><c id="aspace_17643e0be73b285b3ff426cf3ae49c8e" level="file"><did><unittitle>D'Alessandro v. the New York City Board Of Education, et al.</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/1044842</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1995/1995">1995</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_826c24e9833a7f724c7bef1e0a0c7225" label="Mixed Materials [31142054919165]" type="Box">145</container><container id="aspace_8f6f6dd1a35ee1a584394c3fb6caac3d" parent="aspace_826c24e9833a7f724c7bef1e0a0c7225" type="Folder">18</container></did></c><c id="aspace_7a299283e5a990f9eff78734fc88fe8a" level="file"><did><unittitle>De Pastino v. the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T)</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/1044843</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1978/1978">1978</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_809857913da186a4956560023edd69c0" label="Mixed Materials [31142054919173]" type="Box">146</container><container id="aspace_fd404eb0e1d6de47506984069d5289a4" parent="aspace_809857913da186a4956560023edd69c0" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_aadf5b39c3a770f8ac18bda2e423ccb4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Division of Human Rights Lawsuit: National Organization for Women v.

NOW-NYC's priorities include reproductive rights; constitutional equality; LGBTQIA+ rights; promoting diversity; violence against women; and economic and social justice. Crawling of their website began in 2007, and focused on misogyny in media and the Supreme Court decisions to uphold the Federal Abortion Ban. In 2008, a more complete capture of the website was taken and included issues of their newsletter, whatNOW (dating back to 2005); action campaigns related to New York's Reproductive Health Act, the Clinic Access Bill, the Freedom of Choice Act, sex-trafficking, and emergency contraception prices; their political action committee and endorsements; photo galleries from protests; information from their Service Fund; and information from their legal clinics that provide legal assistance and other support regarding discrimination, domestic violence, and other issues. Between 2009-2013, the website contained efforts to support marriage equality, midwifery reform, an Anti-Strangulation Bill, divorce reform legislation, subsidized child care, sexual violence programs, the publication of sex crime statistics, disclosure law for pregnancy service centers, insurance coverage of contraception, equal pay, discriminatory advertising practices, the Reasonable Accommodations for Pregnant Workers Bill, the Violence Against Women Act, and funding for Planned Parenthood. In September 2010, they launched the Take Rape Seriously Campaign. The website also included report cards on how politicians voted on bills supported by NOW-NYC.</p><p>In 2013, the website redesigned and promoted action campaigns related to the Women's Equality Act including: ending sexual harassment in all workplaces, pay equity, pregnancy discrimination, protecting abortion clinics, birth control access, and fighting human trafficking. Between 2014-2017, campaigns included sexual assault in the military; the women's equality agenda; expansion of family court judges; the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores Supreme Court case; untested rape kits; funding for sex-trafficking victims; holding NFL players accountable for domestic abuse; shackling of incarcerated women during childbirth; consent education to schools; the Helms Amendment; ending child marriage; holding police accountable for violence; campaigns against President Trump's cabinet selections; stopping anti-choice legislation; stopping immigration and refugee bans; and increasing birth control access. In 2018, NOW worked in opposition to President Trump's agenda by participating in attempts to prevent the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court; and to increase voting awareness and participation. </p><p>In 2019, the website redesigned to its most recent iteration, as of this writing. Action campaign categories focused on by NOW-NYC include resisting President Trump's agenda; New York City elections; reproductive healthcare and justice; equality and justice; changing laws; and workplace rights. Campaigns through 2022 included holding the NYPD accountable to survivors of sexual assault, mandating sexual education for public school students, ending gun violence, ending abusive practices for home healthcare workers, closing the NY State Intoxication Loophole, and protecting abortion.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_1b77468e2d92f3d87cad174d74cbb507"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl.
