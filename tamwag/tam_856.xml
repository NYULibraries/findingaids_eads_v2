    <abstract id="aspace_510a80ffcda7cc7d86bdbccea5b49f0c">Betty Bressi was a teacher and artist who was recruited to teach in camps in which Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II. Bressi taught in the Jerome War Relocation Center in Arkansas, although her time at the facility ended before World War II concluded. The Betty Bressi Papers (dated 1981-2004) consist of materials created and collected by Bressi documenting her sustained interest in issues surrounding Japanese American incarceration during World War II, Japanese American activism, and the redress movement. Materials include newspaper and magazine articles that document the trajectory of the redress movement, media portrayals of Japanese American activism, and public discourse concerning the concept of reparations. The collection also includes programs and playbills from theatrical productions by the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre. The collection provides rare documentation from white actors involved in the incarceration of Japanese Americans, which is recounted through Bressi's unpublished memoir "Teaching at Jerome Relocation Center." Bressi's active collecting of newspaper coverage of the redress movement, her correspondence with editors regarding their coverage of Japanese American incarceration, and her sustained contact with Madeleine Sugimoto (one of her students at Jerome) and her father, artist Henry Sugimoto, reflects the impact of her experiences on her perspectives after World War II.</abstract>
