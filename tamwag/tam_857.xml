    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Disability Covid Chronicles was a project created by New York University's Center for Disability Studies, to document life for chronically ill and disabled people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mara Mills, Harris Kornstein, Faye Ginsburg, and Rayna Rapp coordinated the project from 2020-2024, compiling digital materials for research for their book <emph render="italic">How to Be Disabled in a Pandemic</emph>. The Disability Covid Chronicles project considered disability to include "neurodivergence, aging, illness, mental disability, injury, and addiction," and those that might not use the term "disabled."</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>In 2025, the Disability Covid Chronicles website was added to the web archives, as well as all websites linked to and featured on the Fieldnotes and Resources pages. Websites were assessed for quality assurance and efforts were made to capture missing embedded materials (videos or attached Google documents and pdfs) in websites and any websites that experienced content drift/redirection since it was added to the website by the creators of Disability Covid Chronicles. An example of content drift in this collection includes the change of URL from twitter.com to x.com. Descriptions were supplied to most websites, but titles were retained from their website. The abbreviated name for <emph render="italic">Coronavirus disease 2019</emph> is used as COVID-19 and Covid-19 interchangeably by the creators of the websites, which is maintained throughout the finding aid.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Disability Covid Chronicles Web Collection (December 2020-October 2025) is made up of archived websites created and compiled by the Disability Covid Chronicles as part of the research for <emph render="italic">How to Be Disabled in a Pandemic</emph> and also to document the experiences of disabled and chronically ill during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020-2024. Materials featured as "fieldnotes" include press releases on COVID-19 guidance during the pandemic; news articles about COVID-19 and Long COVID; social media posts; government documents; survival guides for people facing higher risk of COVID-19 or triage discrimation; videos; podcasts; publicity websites related to documentaries; recaps of virtual events; art exhibitions; and artwork. Other topics documented in the research include masking messaging; government watchdogs related to COVID-19; mutual aid; protest resources; subway accessibility; COVID-19 testing; wastewater and COVID-19 postivity tracking; vaccination; experiences of quarantine; remote work; unemployment; caregiving; and medical rationing. They also documented websites on "disability experiences including incarceration, low wage and essential work, maternal mental health, anti-Asian violence, senior centers, migrant detention centers, Long Covid, public schools, the MTA, blindness and digital accessibility, arts workers, and the Black Lives Matter protests." Alice Wong's work as disability rights activist during the COVID-19 pandemic is also well documented in the collection. Although the project was national in scope, many of the websites focus on the disability community in New York City. The majority of the collection focuses on COVID-19, but there is some materials related to the mpox outbreak in 2022-2023.</p><p>Users should be aware that materials in the collection discuss suicide and violence against disabled people. Materials in the collection also include ableist language, which has been maintained to convey the meaning and reclamation of the language by creators of the material. </p>  </scopecontent>
