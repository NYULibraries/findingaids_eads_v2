    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Spanish Civil War (1936 – 1939) was a conflict between the newly-elected left-leaning government of the Spanish Republic and its supporters and the rebellion against the Republic led by General Francisco Franco and supported by Hitler and Mussolini. Thousands of men and women from around the world volunteered to serve as soldiers and medical and support personnel for the Republic, which organized them into International Brigades (including the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, made up of North Americans). Film was one of the weapons used by international organizations supporting the Republic and the Brigades to document the war and to generate support and raise money; after the war they used moving images to aid the Republic's refugees.</p><p>The major works in the collection include <emph render="italic">With the Lincoln Brigade In Spain,</emph> directed by Henri Cartier-Bresson; footage shot by in Spain circa 1937-1938, by Harry Randall, head of the Photographic Unit of the Fifteenth International Brigade (which functioned as the photographic arm of the Lincoln Brigade); and <emph render="italic">Refuge.</emph></p><p><emph render="italic">With the Lincoln Brigade In Spain</emph> is a short documentary film produced by Herbert Kline, directed by still photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, and shot in 35mm (although distributed in 16 mm) by Cartier-Bresson and movie camera operator Jaques Lemare. It was filmed in 1937 and released in 1938. Shown in union halls, clubs, and other small venues throughout the United States, the documentary was used to raise funds to bring the Brigaders home. Simultaneously, the same production team filmed <emph render="italic">Return to Life</emph> for the American Medical Bureau of the North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy in Spain (AMB). <emph render="italic">Refuge</emph> was shot in 1939 to publicize the plight of Spanish Republican refugees in refugee camps in France and show the conditions in these camps. It was produced by Ciné Liberté and the AMB, directed by Jean-Paul Le Chanois (also known as Jean-Paul Dreyfuss), and edited by Irving Lerner. It includes footage from (and may be a shortened version of) <emph render="italic">Un peuple attend,</emph> another documentary on the same subject shot earlier that year, and also directed by Le Chanois.</p><p>Sources:</p><p>• Crusells, Magí."REFUGE, a pro-republican documentary from the Spanish Civil War."

<p>The materials in this collection were acquired by the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA)—a non-profit organization devoted to preserving the memory of the volunteers who fought against fascism and to defend the Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War.  ALBA first donated a low-resolution VHS tape of a video transfer of 16mm footage shot by Harry Randall, a member of the Lincoln Brigade, in 1937-1938 (the Library created a screening copy of this VHS); ALBA then donated the balance of the materials to the Tamiment Library in 2009.</p>  </custodhist>
