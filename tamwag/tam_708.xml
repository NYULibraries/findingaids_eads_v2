    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Pamela Sporn is a documentary filmmaker whose films combine personal narratives and archival materials to tell stories about working-class life. Sporn was the daughter of labor activists, leftist scholars, and American Communists. In 1964 her father Paul Sporn gained national attention after he was subpoenaed by the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), and was represented by Ira Gollobin who later inspired Pamela Sporn's work as a documentarian. Sporn's documentaries generally focus on political resistance and the working class. She has produced several documentaries through her production company Grito Productions, including <emph render="italic">Disobeying Orders: G. I. Resistance to The Vietnam War</emph> (1990); <emph render="italic">Remembering the Mamoncillo</emph> (2007), about Afro-Cuban culture in New York City; <emph render="italic">With a Stroke of the Chaveta</emph> (2007), about Cuban cigar factory workers; <emph render="italic">Detroit 48202: Conversations Along a Postal Route</emph> (2017); and <emph render="italic">A Humble Giant: Seventy Years Defending Immigrants and Radicals</emph> (still in production at the time of donation), about immigration lawyer and activist Ira Gollobin.</p>  </bioghist>
