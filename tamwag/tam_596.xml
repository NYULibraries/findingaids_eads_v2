(Japanese American Social Services), a non-profit organization based in New York City dedicated to addressing gaps in social services for the Japanese American community. In 1942, Shimanouchi and her family were forcibly removed from their home and incarerated with 110,00 other Nisei at the Central Utah Relocation Center, a concentration camp (euphemistically referred to as an internment camp) in Topaz, Utah. She later worked for director Michael Todd from 1952 to 1958 and as a press agent for Bill Doll and Company in New York City from 1959 to 1979. The papers document both her personal and  professional life, including her activism efforts for the Japanese American community from the early 1980s until the late 1990s. Materials in the collection include correspondence, oral history transcripts, biographical and family history information, audio and videocassette tapes, photographs, and clippings. Of note are materials concerning Japanese forced removal and incarceration during World War II, including National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) records and scholarly publications that incorporate interviews of Shimanouchi Lederer.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Midori Shimanouchi Lederer (1923-2005) was the founder and president of Japanese American Social Services, Inc. (JASSI), which was established to address gaps in social and cultural service needs of the Japanese and Japanese American community. She founded JASSI when she  was nearing retirement age in 1981. JASSI still remains the only East Coast organization that continues to provide a wide range of social services catering to Japanese and Japanese Americans.</p><p>Born in 1923 to immigrant parents in Fresno, California, Shimanouchi was the youngest of five children. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, she and her family were forcibly removed from their home and incarerated with 110,00 other Nisei at the Central Utah Relocation Center, a concentration camp (euphemistically referred to as an internment camp) in Topaz, Utah. Before World War II, Shimanouchi was a student at University of California at Berkeley. While at the camp, she appealed to the United States government to permit her to continue her studies. Her request was granted and she resumed her studies at Pace College in New York City in 1943.</p><p>In 1952, Shimanouchi became the secretary to film producer Michael Todd. Despite having no background or work-related experience in the film industry, she served multiple roles as office manager, secretary, chief assistant and diplomat, and was Michael Todd's production assistant for <emph render="italic">Around the World in 80 Days</emph>, which earned five Academy Awards. Following Todd's death in 1958, she worked for a year on a film being made in Spain by Michael Todd, Jr. In 1960 she joined the firm formed by Todd's press agent, Bill Doll and Company, a top New York firm of press agents at the time. As vice president of Bill Doll and Co., she handled publicity for Federico Fellini, Maurice Chevalier, Judy Garland, Louis Armstrong, Andre Watts and other prominent artists, which garnered her the title from media outlets as "Broadway's Number 1 Lady Press Agent."</p><p>At the height of her career as a publicist, Shimanouchi married Peter Lederer in 1966. Five years later, she retired and with the encouragement of her husband began to channel her energies toward community volunteer work. In 1971, Shimanouchi began volunteering at a drug rehabilitation agency at the Lower East Side Center, which specialized in helping elderly Chinese individuals experiencing drug dependence. She continued in aiding the senior community by volunteering for the Japanese American Help for the Aging (JAHFA) in 1979. After working with the Japanese American Senior Support Group, Shimanouchi founded JASSI in 1981 at the age of 58. With volunteers Kimi Shimizu and Cyril Nishimoto and a $5000 start-up fund, together they began providing counseling services to Japanese seniors from Shimanouchi's dining room table. With additional fundraising efforts, JASSI then secured the necessary funds to ensure all clients received services free of charge. Shimanouchi's philosophy in social services was to never turn anyone away in need of help. As a result, JASSI's services quickly grew to encompass a broad range of needs, including legal and immigration services, and assistance to restaurant workers, abused women and international students. JASSI's mission further expanded with Shimanouchi's creation of a support group in Japan.</p><p>In recognition of her community activism, Shimanouchi was the first Japanese American woman to receive the Ellis Island Honorary Award in 1992. The following year, she received an Outstanding Asian Americans Award from Governor Mario Cuomo, and a Justice in Action award from the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund in 1997. Her efforts to build bridges between social work for the aged in the United States and Japan also earned her The Order of the Sacred Treasure from the Emperor of Japan. Shimanouchi was a founding member of the board of the Asian American Federation of New York and served on the boards of The Methodist Church Home for the Aged and the Japanese American Association of New York.</p><p>Shimanouchi died on March 9, 2005, at the age of 82.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>As documents formerly lacked categorization and chronology, order was imposed to create separation between personal and professional files, as well as folder level organization. The original arrangement of photo albums was retained. Binders and sticky backing were removed for preservation purposes and photos were re-sleeved. Many photos were identified by Peter Lederer in October 2012 and the information he supplied is denoted in bracket form on the back of each photo. The folders comprising the 2020 accretion were intellectually integrated into the collection's existing series and alphabetic order. In September 2020, narrative description and individual folder titles were edited to more accurately describe the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. In October 2020, Midori Shimanouchi Lederer's biographical note was updated to correct harmful language regarding drug use and dependence.</p><p>Researchers can access previous versions of the finding aid in our GitHub repository at https://github.com/NYULibraries/findingaids_eads/commits/master/tamwag/tam_596.xml.</p><p>In December 2025, loose photographs housed in Box 5 were placed into protective mylar sleeves. </p>  </processinfo>

Note</head><p>Files within this series relate to Shimanouchi-Lederer's professional career as a manager and secretary for Mike Todd Company, a press agent for Bill Doll Company, and her tenure as director of JASSI. The bulk of materials within the series are photographs, some of which are retained in the original order of the albums. 
Photographs from her Michael Todd days document Shimanouchi alongside Michael Todd and former wife, Elizabeth Taylor, in private settings with other celebrities, as well as at other large red carpet events and venues.
Papers from her time at the Michael Todd Company include various newspaper and media clippings, correspondence, press releases.</p><p>The Bill Doll and Company files are mainly comprised of photos, many of which were used for press releases and captured Shimanouchi with famed actors, directors and producers of the 1950s - 1960s. While a large folder of photos from Shimanouchi's publicity days remain unidentified, they offer a glimpse into the publicity networks with which Shimanouchi was affiliated. </p><p>Contents within the JASSI files document programming and events, organizational publications, newsletters, flyers and some correspondence. Writings by former JASSI volunteers and staff members provide contextual community history of JASSI. The bulk of JASSI materials are photo albums documenting various JASSI fundraising events and former staff members of the organization.  </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref36"
