Duplicate tapes were also removed from the collection. The remaining tapes were rehoused in new archival cassette cases (when needed), had media labels adhered to the cases, and placed in acid-free boxes. Original cassette titles were retained, when available.</p><p>In Fall 2025, episode descriptions and titles were updated, when possible.
