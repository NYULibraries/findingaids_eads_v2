    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Graduate Student Organizing Committee (GSOC) represents graduate and research assistants at New York University (NYU) and is affiliated with the United Auto Workers Local 2110. GSOC was the first graduate employee union at a private university to successfully negotiate a contract, in effect from 2001 to 2005, which included major improvements to stipends, benefits and employee rights. In 2004 the National Labor Relations Board reversed the legal precedent of the Brown University decision, which required private universities to negotiate with graduate employees. NYU administration then refused to bargain with GSOC after the expiry of the first contract, leading to a six month strike in 2005-2006. In 2013, following a GSOC petition to the NLRB to reverse the Brown University decision, the NYU administration announced that they would resume collective bargaining with GSOC on the withdrawal of the NLRB petition. In 2015, they signed their second contract. In 2020, that contract expired and the union was on strike in Spring 2021. The contract was ratified on June 6, 2021, after nearly a year of negotiations and a three week strike.</p>  </bioghist>
