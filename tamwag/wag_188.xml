    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>United Automobile Workers of America, Local 2110 Records consist of contracts and agreements between organizations and their employees, pamphlets and brochures, correspondence including emails, shop files, reports, financial material, archived websites, and VHS tapes. The UAW 2110 records reflect their affiliations with a variety of institutional associations. The Brooklyn Historical Society, Long Island Historical Society, National Law Journal, Royal Business School and Riverside Church are among them. Club Med, the vacation company, the Silent Watchman, a home alarm company, and the Glemby Corporation, which in the 1990s was the nation's largest department store hair salon chain, all had distinct subseries in the collection. Glemby Corporation records include occupational safety surveys, as well as negotiations and employee claims. The Silent Watchman negotiations concern the United Wholesale and Warehouse Employees. The records related to District 65 are primarily financial, but also include an election, general information and a Black Lake retreat. The time period covered is from 1980-1989.</p><p>In 2002, NYU's teaching, research and graduate assistants won major economic gains and a first-ever union contract with UAW 2110. In 2004 the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) overturned the decision. There are also some emails related to when NYU which was officially part of UAW 2110 from 2000-2004.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Technical, Office and Professional (TOP) Union, Local 2110, is an amalgamated union with 30 contracts covering over 3,000 workers in universities, publishing, museums, law firms and other offices. They represent teachers, secretaries, administrators, editors, computer operators, librarians, museum curators, typesetters and graphic artists, among many others. The union claims that they've taken the lead in organizing women and workers in non-profits who never had been organized before. They have won benefits such as childcare, flex-time, job classification, domestic partner benefits and family leave and organize and negotiate for "white collar" workers. Their area of representation includes New England, Washington D.C., New York metropolitan area, and Puerto Rico. Some organizations they work with are:</p><p>Addison—Wesley Longman Publishers <lb/> Ames &amp; Rollinson <lb/> AMSCO School Publications <lb/> Barnard College <lb/> Bronx Museum of the Arts <lb/> Church World Service <lb/> Columbia University <lb/> DASNY: Dormitory Authority of the State of New York <lb/> Feminist Press <lb/> GOLES: Good Old Lower East Side <lb/> HarperCollins Publishers <lb/> HFA: New York State Housing Finance Agency <lb/> ICCR: Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility <lb/> Mercy College <lb/> Monthly Review <lb/> Museum of Modern Art, New York <lb/> National Council of Churches <lb/> New Press <lb/> NYANA: New York Association for New Americans <lb/> New York Civil Liberties Union <lb/> New—York Historical Society <lb/> Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky &amp; Lieberman, P.C. <lb/> SONYMA: State of New York Mortgage Agency <lb/> Stamford Advocate <lb/> State Bank of India <lb/> TCI: Technical Careers Institute <lb/> Teachers College <lb/> Union Theological Seminary <lb/> Village Voice <lb/></p><p>District 65 traces its origins to the Wholesale Dry Goods Workers Union and New York's Lower East Side. It was one of many unions formed during the early years of the Great Depression. For a considerable period its membership consisted of primarily Jewish garment workers. The Union has a progressive and politically active history. It stood against McCarthyism during the virulent anti-communist, red scare era and stood against the Vietnam War decades later.  In 1992, District 65 merged with Local 2110. Local 2110 acquired the records of former bargaining units, including academic records primarily addressing organizing campaigns at Yale and Boston University. The Historical Societies, Church Organizations, and Misc are primarily former bargaining units of D 65.</p><p>Some organizing campaigns include: the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, New York University Graduate Student Organizing Committee, Columbia University Teaching and Research Assistants (GSEU), the Hispanic Society, the Guggenheim, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Film Forum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Whitney Museum, and the American Folk Museum. Local 2110 is actively involved in ongoing struggles to unionize each of these institutions. </p><p>Some of the issues UAW 2110 advocates for are healthcare reform, the rights of employees when faced with intimidation by employers for participating in Union activities, and bargaining rights.</p>  </bioghist>
