<p>In July 2025 a storage box containing bullets was assessed by the Preservation Department and the bullets were removed. Due to the illegality of possessing live ammunition in New York City, the Preservation Department transferred the bullets to the local police department for disposal. The cardboard container was retained in the collection.</p>  </appraisal>
