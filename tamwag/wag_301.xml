    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The May Chen Papers is comprised of a gift from May Chen, in addition to some accretions. Processing decisions made prior to 2018 have not been recorded. In 2018, 11 boxes were added the the collection. At the time of accessioning, materials were described at the collection-level and included a brief box-level inventory. Original folders were retained at this time.  Born-digital records in the 2018 accretion were inventoried, but were not forensically imaged. </p><p>The collection was fully processed and described by an archivist in the summer of 2022. During processing, duplicate materials were removed from the collection. Materials were placed in new acid-free folders and boxes. Original folder titles were retained when possible.</p><p>New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content. 15 optical disks were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged using Isobusters and Forensic Toolkit. A single 3.5 inch floppy disk was forensically imaged and analyzed using Kryoflux</p>  </processinfo>
