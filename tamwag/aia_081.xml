    <head>Audiovisual Access Policies and Procedures</head>
<p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item's original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that have already been digitized are noted in the collection's finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>  </accessrestrict>

Material dates from 1917 to 2006, with the bulk between 1947 and 2000, and includes his personal correspondence, half of which is in Irish; drafts and published versions of his writings on Irish culture, language, and history; his notes and research files; scrapbooks; and material used in the production of three television series on Ireland.  McKiernan's correspondents include Brian Friel, Henry Beston, Mairead Nic Dhonnchadha, and Liam Eise.  His notes, research files, and writings show his interest in Irish language and history, particularly the events of the 20th century as relates to the formation of the Republic and the conflict in Northern Ireland.  His interest in the Irish language is documented through a small collection of early 20th century Irish language newspapers, including <emph render="italic">An Lóċrann</emph>, <emph render="italic">Fáinne An Lae</emph>, and <emph render="italic">An Gaedeal</emph>.  The scrapbooks document McKiernan's work as an educator and with the Irish American Cultural Institution and include correspondence, photographs, newspaper clippings, and event ephemera.  The three television series McKiernan wrote and narrated in the 1960s, <emph render="italic">Ireland: The Past in the Present</emph>, <emph render="italic">Ireland Rediscovered</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Irish Diary</emph>, are included in this series.  Materials related to these titles include scripts, photographs, slides, and correspondence.
