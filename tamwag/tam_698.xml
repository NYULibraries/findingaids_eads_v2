    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Maggie Block is a self-proclaimed "red diaper baby" born in Brooklyn and when she was in junior high school, she moved to Nassau County with her family. From a young age, Block's family instilled in her the importance of being politically and socially active; and this drove her to find ways to make the world a better and more just place. Block's family also encouraged her to follow her love of art; and to find joy in both art and social justice. In high school, Block was involved with civil rights and anti-nuclear activities. She also created collages, constructions, wood cuts, and lino cuts. These experiences in high school set the groundwork for Block's lifelong search for ways to combine her interest in art, her political activity, and the ability to earn a living. </p><p>Block was curious about the 1959 Cuban Revolution and the new socialist society formed in the Revolution's aftermath; and after graduating from a New York State university in 1969, she went to Cuba as a member of the second Venceremos Brigade, an international organization founded in 1969 by members of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and officials of the Republic of Cuba. As a member of the Venceremos Brigade, Block cut sugar cane, explored how the Cuban people were building their new society, and showed her support for the new socialist state by opposing the American embargo against Cuba. </p><p>While serving with the Venceremos Brigade, Block learned about the New York City Street Theater, a traveling political theater. The prospect of working with a close-knit group of like-minded people creatively engaged with the issues of the day strongly resonated with her. As a member of the Theater, she made masks and costumes; and, alongside other company members, wrote stories and performed the plays. Block's time with the New York City Street Theater brought two important parts of her life together: social change and art. </p><p>During a performance at the Anderson Federal Women's Prison in West Virginia, Block met Lolita Lebr√≥n, a Puerto Rican nationalist and political prisoner. This interaction led Block to learn more about the colonial relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States; and she later joined the Puerto Rico Solidarity Committee (PRSC), a group working with the Puerto Rican Socialist Party across the U.S. advocating for the independence and self-determination for Puerto Rico. As a member of the PRSC, Block created a newsletter, <emph render="italic">Puerto Rico Libre</emph>, and other materials that were circulated throughout chapters in the U.S. In 1975, Block moved to Puerto Rico with her partner, a newly certified labor lawyer, and helped him set up a labor law firm designed to train Puerto Rican lawyers to handle federal labor law and work on behalf of the independent unions. Later in 1975, Block worked as a member of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party's electoral campaign and created printed materials. </p><p>Block was in graduate school during the Vietnam War, but eventually withdrew from school to work full-time as a staff person for the People's Coalition for Peace &amp; Justice (PCPJ), a national anti-Vietnam War organization. While at PCPJ, she learned how to cut screens to make posters, as well as how to write and produce fact sheets, buttons, leaflets and newsletters. In 1973, Block volunteered with other artists to make posters and banners for the World Youth Festival in Berlin in the German Democratic Republic. </p><p>In addition to PCPJ, Block was a volunteer at the North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA), where she learned more about design and layout. Block later joined the Chile Solidarity Committee, which was created in the wake of the September 1973 coup in Chile. Through this work, she learned more about the issues surrounding American intervention in Latin America; issues arising in Nicaragua with the Sandinistas; and ongoing issues in Puerto Rico.  </p><p>In 1977, Block returned to New York City from Puerto Rico and founded the art studio Three to Make Ready Graphics with other artists from PCPJ. The goal of Three to Make Ready Graphics was to find a way to earn a living with art and design, while participating with community and progressive organizations. Three to Make Ready Graphics closed in 1989 when the building housing the studio was sold. Block became a freelance worker, continuing to work for various organizations including her largest client at the time, the Amalgamated Clothing &amp; Textile Workers Union (ACTWU). According to Block, "though I went to neither "fine art" nor graphic design school, I learned whatever skills I have from and with other activists and artists in the organizations in which I worked."</p>  </bioghist>
