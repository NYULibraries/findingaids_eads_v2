<p>The Pratt Faculty Union, UFCT Local 1460, represents full-time and part-time faculty members at the Pratt Institute. The union signed their first collective bargaining agreement in 1973, after years of organizing at the Pratt Institute in the 1960s. The first president of the union was Estelle Horowitz.
