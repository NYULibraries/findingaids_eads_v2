<p>At the time of accessioning, materials were moved into archival housing, a preliminary file list was created, and a series-level finding aid was created to describe these materials. No physical processing or arrangement was done at this time. In September 2015 an addition to the collection was rehoused and appended to the existing series based on subject or format; computer files were imaged, analyzed, and assigned unique component IDs.</p>  </processinfo>
