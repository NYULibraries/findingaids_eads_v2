The Jaime Taylor and Zachary Loeb Collection on the Occupy Wall Street Library (dated 1998-2014) consists of materials created and collected by Taylor and Loeb. The collection documents the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) encampment at Zuccotti Park in New York City; the creation, activities, and belongings of the OWS Library; the political activities of OWS and affiliated protests; and the library's eviction from the park by the New York Police Department (NYPD). Materials in this collection include ephemera, correspondence, administrative files, protest fliers, zines, and realia – some of which are directly related to the library's eviction by the NYPD in November 2011. The collection also includes a small amount of materials on librarianship, including an article and conference programs.</abstract>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Occupy Wall Street (OWS) Library, also known as the People's Library, was founded in September 2011 by Occupy Wall Street protesters in Lower Manhattan's Zuccotti Park and was led by librarian Betsy Fagin. Over time, the People's Library received books and resource donations from readers, private citizens, authors, and corporations. Musician Patti Smith also contributed a tent to the library, which was named Fort Patti in her honor, and was used as the library's primary structure until it was destroyed in November 2011.</p><p>On November 15, 2011, officers from the New York Police Department (NYPD) and employees from the New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY) forcibly evicted everyone in Zuccotti Park. Following a decision ordered by New York City officials and the Park's owners (Brookfield Office Properties), NYPD and DSNY employees loaded the library's approximately 5,500+ book collection into garbage trucks and moved them to a sanitation site. Although New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg, stated the library's collection was safely stored at the sanitation site and could be retrieved at a later date, library representatives later learned most of the library's collection and equipment had been destroyed, damaged, or lost. </p><p>In May 2012, the OWS Library sued Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, and Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty in federal court. In April 2013, the city was ordered to pay $366,700 to the People's Library for the raid.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The Jaime Taylor and Zachary Loeb Collection on the Occupy Wall Street Library (dated 1998-2014) consists of materials created and collected by librarians Jaime Taylor and Zachary Loeb. The collection documents the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) encampment at Zuccotti Park in New York City; the creation, activities, and belongings of the OWS Library, also referred to as The People's Library; political activities of OWS and affiliated protests; and the library's eviction from the park by the New York Police Department (NYPD) on November 15, 2011, which lay the groundwork for the subsequent lawsuit against the city of New York.</p><p>Materials in this collection include administrative files, correspondence, and legal resources; ephemera and posters; protest materials; examples of library holdings and zines published by local artists; publications, both from within the OWS movement and outside; and realia including a broken laptop and cashbox, which are directly related to the library's eviction by the NYPD in November 2011.

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>At the time of accessioning, materials were rehoused in archival boxes. Loose paper materials were rehoused in archival folders in their existing order. Born-digital items were identified and inventoried, but were not forensically imaged, analyzed, or described at this time. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content.</p><p>In March 2025, the collection was arranged and described by an archivist. Some materials were rehoused into new archival folders. Titles reflecting the contents of folders were created when not present. Related materials were grouped together both physically and intellectually. Oversized materials folded within legal folders were unfolded and rehoused into appropriately sized folders and flat boxes. After two copies of paper materials were kept, additional copies of materials were removed from the collection and returned to the donor. </p><p>A damaged encyclopedia and a torn Occupy Wall Street poster were sent to New York University's Barbara Goldsmith Preservation and Conservation Department for stabilization and rehousing.</p><p>Materials in the collection were described at the collection and series level; and inventoried at the file level. </p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Appraisal</head>
<p>On October 30, 2023, Curator for Tamiment Collections Shannon O'Neill and Head of Archival Collections Management Weatherly Stephan discussed the nature of the damaged electronics within this collection. Electronics in the collection include a Kindle, a laptop, and a radio receiver. This technology was used to serve the Occupy Wall Street Library, also known as the People's Library. All of the electronics and hardware presently in the collection sustained damage during the NYPD's raid and eviction of the People's Library on November 15th, 2011. As such, they are inoperable. Going forward, these items serve as artifactual evidence of the destruction of the Library. We will retain them for this purpose; however, the technology is not meant to be utilized and no data that may possibly exist on the technology is retrievable.</p><p>In March 2025, attempts were made to image two optical discs using FTK Imager, however, these attempts were unsuccessful and these discs were removed from the collection. One optical disc containing a video was imaged using IsoBuster, however due to the copyright nature of the video's content, this disc was removed from the collection. Copies of <emph render = "italic">The Nation</emph>, <emph render = "italic">International Socialist Review</emph>, <emph render = "italic">Labor Notes</emph>, <emph render = "italic">Time Magazine</emph>, <emph render = "italic">Village Voice</emph>, <emph render = "italic">am New York</emph>, <emph render = "italic">The Catholic Worker</emph>, <emph render = "italic">The Indypendent</emph> and <emph render = "italic">Occupy! Gazette</emph> -- all of which are dated between 2011 and 2012 -- were removed from the collection due to online accessibility from the publisher's individual websites. </p>  </appraisal>

The protest materials include fliers and informational handouts from OWS events; and affiliated events including May Day, Occupy National Gathering, and Occupy Guitarmy. Some protest materials are not directed at specific events, but rather focus on topics such as Black Lives Matter, student debt forgiveness, universal healthcare, the antiwar movement, and environmentalism. The realia included in this series consists of, but are not limited to: a broken cash box, laptop, books, and Kindle e-reader – all of which were used in the library and retained in the collection, despite their broken state, to document the destruction of the library by the NYPD in November 2011.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_a607b3a20a25abda4121a5f3b2288aed" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ephemera -- Fabric  Occupy Wall Street Protest Signs</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/1023853</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container altrender="Box 22 x 19" id="aspace_918c7a1c88d1039f152d05fa08439eb8" label="Realia [31142067157761]" type="Box">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_2214c254078b2103cf0a50cb24f0b848" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ephemera -- Labor Sign</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/1023854</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
