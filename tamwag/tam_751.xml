    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Collection of Women's Rights Serials groups 408 titles broadly relating to women's rights, published between 1907 and 2010, originally received by the Tamiment Library through subscriptions, donations, and as part of archival collections. The majority of the collection consists of incomplete runs of newspapers, newsletters, magazines, and bulletins, with a smaller quantity of one-off reports and catalogs, published by women's rights organizations, encompassing activist networks, research bodies, academic institutions, government agencies, and nonprofits. A significant quantity of the collection dates from the 1970s and 1980s, when interest in women's rights surged, chronicling early mainstream discourse around the women's liberation movement. The serials provide contemporaneous coverage of a wide range of issues of concern to women and feminist groups between the 1970s and early 2000s, broadly addressing gender equality, workplace discrimination, sexuality, reproductive rights, and female solidarity. </p><p>Among the topics addressed in the serials are equal pay, gender discrimination in employment, activism for workplace and organizational justice, sexual harassment, mental health, abortion and reproductive health, sexual assault, international solidarity, and childrearing and motherhood. A small number of publications dating from the early 20th century also document women's suffrage movements in the United States and Great Britain. There are also several publications addressing male sexuality and gender identity. These publications largely reflect solidarity with the women's liberation movement, and explore social constructions of masculinity.</p><p>Many periodicals come from independent regional publishers in the United States, while a small amount were produced by international publishers in Canada, Europe, China, Australia, Pakistan, and Cuba. The National Organization for Women (NOW) is among the most prominently featured publishers, with publications from the organization's national body as well as regional chapters. No complete runs of publications are contained herein, and generally only a handful of issues of each publication are held.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
<p>This collection combines serials relating to the women's rights movement drawn from two discrete groups of material held by the Tamiment Library. The first was a partially inventoried backlog of serials, received by the library through donations, subscriptions, and in archival collections. The second group consisted of around 1,700 serials, newspapers, and magazines, organized by title as an artificial collection, referred to as Periodicals.001 or Boxed Newspapers. This material was combined, inventoried, and arranged and described in subject-based categories in 2017. The accession number related to this collection is 2017.049.</p>  </acqinfo>

<p>The material in this collection was assembled from various backlogs of uncataloged material held by the Tamiment Library. This material was inventoried, separated according to its subject matter, and arranged in a series of subject-based artificial collections. Accumulations of similar material relating to Communist and Socialist movements were identified, and grouped according to their place of publication. Within each series, serials are arranged alphabetically by publishing organization, with titles generally listed alongside their publishing organization and place of publication.</p><p>In December 2025, copies of the <emph render = "italic">National NOW Times </emph>; <emph render = "italic">NOW NYC News</emph>; <emph render = "italic">NOW News</emph>; <emph render = "italic">Do It Now</emph>; <emph render = "italic">Notes from the First Year: New York Radical Women</emph>; <emph render = "italic">Notes from the Third Year: Women's Liberation</emph>; <emph render = "italic">Now Acts</emph>; <emph render = "italic">Political Times</emph>; <emph render = "italic">WomaNews</emph>; <emph render = "italic">NOW-NYS Action Report</emph>; <emph render = "italic">National Task Force on Marriage, Divorce, and Family Relations</emph>; and the <emph render = "italic">Marriage, Divorce, and the Family Newsletter</emph> were removed from the National Organization for Women: New York City Chapter Records (TAM 106) and added to TAM 751.
