    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Richard B. Gregg (1885–1974) was an American social philosopher and pacifist influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy. He formulated an early Western theory of nonviolent resistance, which informed the work of figures such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Bayard Rustin. He also connected his pacifist views to a broader idea of deliberate and simple living, which he called "voluntary simplicity." His book, <emph render = "italic">The Power of Non-Violence</emph> (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1934), introduced Gandhi's teachings to Western audiences. It was revised in 1944 (2nd edition) and again in 1959 (3rd edition), the latter including a foreword by Martin Luther King Jr.</p>  </bioghist>
