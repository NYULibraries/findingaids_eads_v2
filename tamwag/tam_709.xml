Alger Hiss was a State Department official who was accused of Soviet espionage, and was eventually convicted of perjury in 1950. Interviews in the collection were recorded between 2001 and 2004 as part of an oral history project created by The Nation Institute following Hiss's death in 1996, and feature individuals who spent time with Hiss later in his life. Interviewees discuss their personal relationships with Hiss between the 1970s and 1990s, and focus on impressions of him during those years. Several interviewees were among a group of young volunteers who read books to Hiss when he began to lose his eyesight. Many interviews focus on how the interviewees' personal relationships with Hiss shaped their views about the charges against him.</abstract>

<p>The Nation Institute Oral History Collection on Alger Hiss was created by The Nation Institute with funding from the Isabel Johnson Hiss Fund. The project was initiated shortly after Alger Hiss's death in 1996 to record his friends' and family's memories about him. </p><p>Alger Hiss (1904-1996) was a State Department official who served in the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and was involved in the establishment of the United Nations. In 1948 Hiss was named as a communist by Whittaker Chambers in a hearing before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Hiss was called before HUAC to testify and later filed a defamation lawsuit against Chambers. During the trial process Chambers produced evidence that Hiss had been involved in espionage, and in 1950 Hiss was sentenced to three years in prison for perjury.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>At the time of processing, oral history interviews were arranged in alphabetical order, and brief descriptions were created for each interview. Physical transcripts, which were originally grouped in booklets by the donor,  have been maintained in their original order.</p><p>Duplicate transcripts both in paper and electronic formats were removed from the collection. Additionally, tapes were originally accompanied by notes listing the names of individuals mentioned in each interview. These notes were discarded because they were deemed to contain insufficient contextual or descriptive information.</p><p>In 2024, individual listings for original recording, transcript, and access copy were added to each interview subject in the inventory.</p><p>In December 2025, digital objects for processed electronic records were created to conform to current practices. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content. Digital files were forensically analyzed and arranged using Forensic Toolkit.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Nation Institute Oral History Collection on Alger Hiss (dated 2001-2004) consists of 41 interviews with individuals acquainted with Alger Hiss. Interviews were conducted between 2001 and 2004 and largely feature individuals who were close with Hiss later in his life. Several of the individuals featured were life-long friends, but others featured are younger individuals who were recruited to read for Hiss as his sight began to fail him in his old age. Interviews focus primarily on the subjects' personal relationships with Hiss, their perceptions of him as a person, his intellectual and literary interests, and his family life. They also feature discussions about Alger Hiss's trials and the continued analysis of the evidence against him. These discussions address topics including Whittaker Chambers's accusations, evidence introduced during the trials, the 1996 release of the Venona papers, Allen Weinstein's book <emph render="italic">Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case</emph>, and Russian historian Dimitri Volkogonov.</p><p>A large portion of the interviews were conducted by Albert Rubin, who was the first historian working on the Alger Hiss Oral History Project. Other interviews were conducted by oral historian Jeff Kisseloff and Hiss's attorney Ellyn Polshek, both of whom continued the project after Rubin retired in 2002. Interviews are recorded on audio cassette with accompanying physical or electronic transcripts. The interview with Victor Chapin does not have an audio recording and is only available in a transcript.</p>  </scopecontent>

In the first part Hobson talks about his mother Priscilla Hiss, his father Thayer Hobson, and his relationship with Alger Hiss. The first part of the interview also focuses on the testimony of Whittaker Chambers, and Hobson's memories of the years in which Chambers claimed to be associated with the Hiss family. The second part of the interview largely focuses on Hiss's life after his conviction and his release from prison. Much of this section focuses on family dynamics between Hiss, his son Tony, and his second wife Isabel. The third part of the interview returns to Chambers's account of his relationship with Hiss and contains some more pointed questions about the degree to which his testimony conflicts with Hobson's memories.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_66c8f7fe08afb22fa1d082b30cab4011" level="file"><did><unittitle>Paper Transcript</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/1014610</unitid><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_d2f8f4c72db554ec84ed08832a3f48b9" label="Mixed Materials [31142054855914]" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_0e74774fc9cb95129df56b60dcd61745" parent="aspace_d2f8f4c72db554ec84ed08832a3f48b9" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_3faba5dbfd551ee94c2ba42ebb128540" level="file"><did><unittitle>Original Recording</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/1014611</unitid><container altrender="Hollinger Cassette Box 5" id="aspace_6526977acd0d25faf3bb6efb2ecd60ef" label="Audio [31142054855922]" type="Box">2</container><container id="aspace_6386b9bbb0f60b024e5aa4e48f1ce69c" parent="aspace_6526977acd0d25faf3bb6efb2ecd60ef" type="Cassette">168 A-C</container></did></c><c id="aspace_b36c20a189322a7de946b9022372a89b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Access Copy</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/1014612</unitid><container altrender="Card Box - 6.5 - long" id="aspace_d2af966fef7957e5226a319d033fbf9b" label="Audio [31142062760015]" type="Box">5</container><container id="aspace_23308c3ddc02ea335c20965aab2be737" parent="aspace_d2af966fef7957e5226a319d033fbf9b" type="CD">1-5</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_9fb1216f82bc144976a5d7dc09fdcf3a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Horan, Tim</unittitle><unitid>cuid169</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/732604</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2001/2001">2001 May 1</unitdate><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="https://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/c59zwbk5" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Horan, Tim" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Horan, Tim: 2001 May 1</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_beb1998c65dd109c31d51205d91c8787"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This interview was conducted by Albert Ruben on May 1, 2001.
