    <abstract id="aspace_a7f63b521ee944aecaa09e5355e234e7" label="Abstract">Founded in 1973, Creative Time is a public arts organization based in New York City. The organization has a history of commissioning, producing, and presenting public artworks worldwide. Three core values guide the organization's work: "art matters, artists' voices are important in shaping society, and public spaces are places for creative and free expression." The materials in this collection document all aspects of the creation, production, promotion, exhibition, and reception of commissioned artworks from 1974-2012, as well as their web presence starting in 2020. Notable projects in the collection include <emph render='italic'>Tribute of Light</emph>, the two beacons of light that illuminated lower Manhattan for six months after 9/11 (2001-2002); <emph render='italic'>Playing the Building</emph> by David Byrne (2008); and <emph render='italic'>Wink</emph> by Takashi Murakami, among many others.</abstract>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Founded in 1973, Creative Time is a nonprofit arts organization that supports the creation of innovative, site-specific works by professional artists for public presentation in vacant spaces of historical and architectural interest throughout New York City. Its history of commissioning, producing, and presenting adventurous public artworks of all disciplines began in the midst of a significant period in which artists were experimenting with new forms and media that moved their works out of galleries and museums and into the public realm. Programs sponsored by Creative Time include both the visual and performing arts and are designed to encourage a dialogue between the artist and the community. </p><p>Their earliest programs invigorated vacant storefronts as well as neglected public spaces such as the Great Hall of the Chamber of Commerce in Lower Manhattan and the arches of the Brooklyn Bridge Anchorage. From 1983-2001, Creative Time presented <emph render='italic'>Art in the Anchorage</emph> for annual exhibitions of emerging creative practices in art, music, theater, and fashion until its closure in 2001 due to national security.</p><p>Creative Time gained early renown for initiating <emph render='italic'>Art on the Beach</emph> on two acres of landfill known as Battery Park City, an area targeted for future residential and commercial development. From 1978-1985, this site became a laboratory for artists of all mediums to develop large scale works and collaborate, bringing together architects, sculptors, performers, and musicians. The success of <emph render='italic'>Art on the Beach</emph> became a model for the presentation of temporary public art for other city governments and arts agencies.</p><p>Creative Time's Citywide program was inaugurated in 1989 and provided a forum for individual artists to control the presentation of their work in public places and for the public to have greater access to artists and their process. Presenting projects on billboards, landmark buildings, buses, deli cups, milk cartons, ATM machines, and the Internet, among numerous other venues, and encouraging artists to address timely issues such as the AIDS pandemic, domestic violence, and racial inequality, Creative Time broadened the definitions of both art and public space throughout the 1980s and 1990s. </p><p>From 1973-1986, Creative Time was under the leadership of Anita Contini and continued until Cee Scott Brown took over as director in 1987. Anne Pasternak stepped in as director in 1993 and continued in this position through the 2010s. Today, Creative Time continues to provide hundreds of emerging and established artists with opportunities to create new works that expand their practices and foster career growth. Creative Time's alumni community includes Laurie Anderson, Beth B., David Byrne, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Red Grooms, Jenny Holzer, Marcos Kurtycz, Takashi Murakami, Shirin Neshat, and Elizabeth Streb, among thousands more. Creative Time has remained committed to promoting collaboration within the creative community, frequently partnering with institutions like the The Kitchen, Lincoln Center, Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, MTA Arts for Transit, and the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs.</p><p>References:</p><p>1.

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Decisions regarding arrangement, description, and physical interventions for this collection prior to 2023 are unknown. In January 2023, an archivist and conservator rehoused Series III: Slides into new binders. Binder and sleeve numbers have been updated accordingly.</p><p>The original donated materials were processed circa 2008. Materials were arranged in the following 8 series: Series I: Exhibitions and Projects; Series II: Grants, Development, and Financial Correspondence; Series III: Slides; Series IV: Photo Materials; Series V: Video and Film; Series VI: Audio; Series VII: Mail Art - Marcos Kurtycz; Series VIII: Oversize Series. The collection was reorganized into three series in October 2023, with the original Series III-VIII intellectually incorporated into Series I.</p><p>At the time of processing the 2014 accretion, the collection was arranged and described into series based on the order established circa 2008, and the types of materials. Materials were placed in acid-free folders and boxes. Financial materials (bank statements, receipts, and invoices), duplicate publications and documents, publications available online, documents with sensitive personal information, blank disks, and system disks were removed. Cups, exhibition signs, a banner, and pins were rehoused. Six flat file folders mistakenly identified as part of Creative Time Records were transferred to the correct collection, Mabou Mines Archive (MSS 133). </p><p>158 floppy disks, DVDs, and CDs were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.</p><p>In 2023, archived websites were added to the resource record. Additional websites were added in August 2024.</p><p>In June 2024, photographic prints, negatives, and contacts sheets in record cartons (boxes 14-19) were rehoused into manuscript boxes (boxes 14-19, 104-109, and 133-141). A list of original box and folder numbers with corresponding rehoused box and folder numbers is available.</p><p>In January 2025, box 1 was rehoused into manuscript boxes. Materials from this box are now found in boxes boxes 1, 142, and 143.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Creative Time Records (1974-2012, 2020-ongoing) contains materials that document the organization's commitment to, and history of, commissioning, producing, and presenting public artworks of all disciplines, both nationally and internationally. The bulk of the collection consists of exhibition and project materials from the organization's inception in 1974 through 2012. These materials include extensive production and promotional materials (such as artists' CVs and biographies; blueprints; site and installation photographs; slides, photographs of artists' work in print and digital formats; exhibition catalogs, postcards, and invitations; exhibition reviews; and accepted proposals for Creative Time sponsored projects such as <emph render='italic'>Art at the Anchorage</emph> and Citywide) that document all aspects of the creation, exhibition, and reception of the commissioned artworks and projects. Additionally, since many of the projects and exhibitions took place in New York, they reflect the organization's influence on the landscape (as in the rehabilitation of public spaces such as the Great Hall of the Chamber of Commerce in Lower Manhattan and the arches of the Brooklyn Bridge Anchorage). The collection also includes grant and fundraising materials (applications, reports, and fundraising campaign documents such as mailings and invitations to benefits) that reflect how the organization has financially supported its mission. Lastly, there is administrative material (general correspondence, certificates, art education program documentation, materials related to conference and symposia participation, and materials on the organization's possible merger with another art organization) that reflects the organization's growth. The collection also includes archived websites related to Creative Time and their commissioned projects first captured in 2020.</p>  </scopecontent>

These materials include artists' information (CVs, slides/videos/photographs, and artists' statements); blueprints; rental contracts; permits; correspondence; proposals; exhibition catalogs, brochures, and invitations to openings; site photographs; installation photographs; budgets; reviews; press releases; promotional items (hats, T-shirts, and cups); digital images and videos (mockups for exhibitions, images of final exhibitions and installations, and test runs and tours of installations), and mailed objects created by artist Marcos Kurtycz. Additionally, samples of artists' earlier or later work are included, most likely sent as part of their proposal packages. Also included are unrealized projects and in a few cases, exhibitions or projects not supported by Creative Time. The vast size of the production materials for each exhibition depicts the complexities involved in commissioning public art projects and the variety of locations, both national and international, selected for exhibitions.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref13" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render='italic'>Crafts in Action</emph> by Multiple Artists</unittitle><unitid

The website also features a blog with news from the arts organization, event listings at CTHQ, and information on the Creative Time Summit. The website also documents their projects in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Their web presence also includes projects related to the Creative Time Think Tank and other 50th anniversary celebrations in 2021.</p><p>The series also includes multiple digital publications, including their two Tumblr blogs and Creative Time Reports (2012-2017).
