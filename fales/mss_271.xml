    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Kathleen Hanna was an early instigator of the Riot Grrrl movement in the early 1990's in both Olympia, Washington and Washington, DC. Along with Allison Wolfe she organized the first Riot Grrrl meeting, collaborated on several early Riot Grrrl zines, and was a major force behind the first Riot Grrrl Convention. </p><p>From 1990-1997 she was a member of the most widely recognized "Riot Grrrl Band", Bikini Kill. She co-authored the band's zines, including their 1992 Bikini Kill #2 which used the phrase "Girl Power" for the first time. Bikini Kill toured the states extensively and also played shows in Europe, Japan and Australia.</p><p>Her second large scale feminist DIY project was the electronic band Le Tigre which was active from 1999-2006. This band used activism as a jumping-off point for their visually stimulating live shows and their three full-length albums. Le Tigre played everywhere, from Massachussetts to St. Petersburg.</p><p>Hanna currently lives in NYC and is active as a musician and lecturer.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The collection was first processed in 2010. It was reprocessed in March 2012 to address preservation concerns. Materials were redistributed among more folders, and selected items were flattened or rehoused in Mylar. At this time, the collection was renumbered and box and folder numbers were changed. To see the original box and folder numbers, please ask a Fales archivist for a copy of the original finding aid, stored in our administrative files. In 2016 an accretion received in 2015 was added to the collection as a new series (2015 Accretion) in keeping with previous arrangement and description decisions.</p><p>In August 2017, one item was prepared to be moved to offsite art storage in September 2017. In March 2023, an accretion of materials documenting the Julie Ruin was rehoused in archival boxes and folders, and integrated into the collection's existing arrangement structure. In May 2024, an oversize felt banner was rehoused and moved to flat file storage by conservators.</p><p>In January 2026, digital objects for processed electronic records were created to conform to current practices. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content. Digital files were forensically analyzed and arranged using Isobusters.</p>  </processinfo>

Fingers also addresses the ubiquity of the white male perspective, oppression and stereotyping of racial minorities, the tensions and superficiality endemic to family life, and the power and entrapment of beauty are explored. Writings on sexual fantasy and relationships counter musings on isolation and abandonment.

The social movement is also considered in broader terms, with discussions on complacency and dogma that diminish radical activism, origins of the movement, and calls for participation. Manifesto writings by Kathleen Hanna are included. Other themes include the questioning of acting and being perceived as cool and the refusal to explain feminist motives and actions to men. Also contains a letters from male and female fans about feminism, an excerpt on fat oppression and liberation, an interview with dyke band Tribe 8 on punk and challenging conceptions of lesbianism, a piece on sex worker self-advocacy, and and extended list of debunked male criticisms of feminism. Local scene news is also discussed.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref601" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bikini Kill Zine #2 [2 of 2] [Kathleen Hanna's Original Folder]</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/537753</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">[1991]</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

Her obsession with the public figure is documented as both a distraction from and an abstract reflection on her continuing areas of thought. She discusses his background of privilege, ability to successfully exploit his sexuality for fame, and considers the vapidity of his personality on the basis of his public persona. This is contrasted with discussions on the demonization of sex workers, and musings on the antisocial serial killer of feminists, Mark Lepine. Hanna reiterates her frustration with the tension between her feelings of desire and repulsion toward Dando.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref619" level="file"><did><unittitle>My Life With Evan Dando Popstar [zine] [2 of 2] [Kathleen Hanna's Original Folder]</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/537787</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">[1994]</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_bb6680587ce7f1c0648f6f14ca15cf81" label="Mixed Materials [31142054880128]" type="Box">2</container><container id="aspace_7b64692f7183baa59e435cee97905cb2" parent="aspace_bb6680587ce7f1c0648f6f14ca15cf81" type="Folder">18</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref234" level="file"><did><unittitle>My Life With Evan Dando Popstar [zine master]</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/537788</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">[1994]</unitdate><container altrender="Flat Box - 12 x 16" id="aspace_e75a5fd4e2fcce9b458186f82189ea9b" label="Mixed Materials [31142054880151]" type="Box">11</container><container id="aspace_236b1d797f29be9c694617a5a03a3cc9" parent="aspace_e75a5fd4e2fcce9b458186f82189ea9b" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref136" level="file"><did><unittitle>Resume [1 of 3]</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/537789</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_9a06ea7b3c6a97790973b182fb0a55fe" label="Mixed Materials [31142054880128]" type="Box">2</container><container id="aspace_2e11c98be2ea2c2ba97be37c1285e4c6" parent="aspace_9a06ea7b3c6a97790973b182fb0a55fe" type="Folder">19</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref620" level="file"><did><unittitle>Resume [2 of 3]</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/537790</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_9f8ce9a95354271138158e70db4e9e66" label="Mixed Materials [31142054880128]" type="Box">2</container><container id="aspace_e45f8903e8dff5181ca02e55af67d7fa" parent="aspace_9f8ce9a95354271138158e70db4e9e66" type="Folder">20</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref621" level="file"><did><unittitle>Resume [3 of 3] [Kathleen Hanna's Original Folder]</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/537791</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_0621f224a0faa8d8687011b1a0132e21" label="Mixed Materials [31142054880128]" type="Box">2</container><container id="aspace_1748f288643c9a675dcf64b2d7e0f694" parent="aspace_0621f224a0faa8d8687011b1a0132e21" type="Folder">21</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref282" level="file"><did><unittitle>Notebook- "Riot Grrrl Test Patterns"</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/537792</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_deccde9cb18099a28cdc970b5584dd1e" label="Mixed Materials [31142054880128]" type="Box">2</container><container id="aspace_97521d93cea34dc721aa218282baa398" parent="aspace_deccde9cb18099a28cdc970b5584dd1e" type="Folder">22</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref137" level="file"><did><unittitle>[Riot Grrrl Zines/Flyers] [1 of 2] </unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/537793</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_810d83b82ef651bebd1189c6434e679d" label="Mixed Materials [31142054880128]" type="Box">2</container><container id="aspace_791a496851c6d1130cfa7dc1cfdf7a3a" parent="aspace_810d83b82ef651bebd1189c6434e679d" type="Folder">23</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_825347743d668ec4d586a96c41737267"><head>Abstract</head><p><emph render="bold">Riot Grrrl</emph> [NYC] [no. 5]</p><p>Quotes from various girls about what riot grrrl means are dispersed throughout this zine.

Calls for participation include sexual abuse and radical activism projects. Personal writings cover relationships with mothers abundantly, in addition to the destructive effects of drug use to friendship.

Later entries include a memoir concerning domestic violence in the family, sketches, and a "fashion doctrine corollary" that considers personal appearance in light of social and personal struggle. Following are first-person writings on empathy, the desire to share strength with women who have been sexually objectified by men, critiques of religion in the context of domestic violence, and the insecurity of adolescence.

The upcoming International Pop Underground festival is emphasized. Following entries contain personal writings covering female empowerment (Kathleen Hanna's "Burn Down the Walls that Say You Can't"), the oppression of heteronormativity, ironic erotic fiction, the D.C.

Early in the zine, she describes her role as a resource for women seeking counsel about domestic violence and sexual abuse, as well as her inability to maintain this effort for the large number of victims seeking support. She offers advice and points toward alternative media and resources centered on these issues. Numerous updates on Bikini Kill are provided, as well as personal recommendations, reviews, and contact information for zines and music.
