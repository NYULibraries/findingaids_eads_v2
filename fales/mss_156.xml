    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Andrea Callard was born in Chicago in 1950 and grew up in Muncie, Indiana. She graduated from highschool at Hingswood School Cranbrook in 1968 and continued her education (1968-1970)at Washington University's School of Fine Arts in St. Louis and graduated from San Francisco Art Institute with a BFA in painting in 1972. In San Francisco, Callard found a rich artistic community including Jim Vincent, Bonnie O'Neill, Baylor Trapnell, Mac Becket, Carol Williams, Reese Williams, and Robin Winters.</p><p>In 1973 Andrea Callard moved to New York City and into an apartment at 150 Chambers St. Again, Callard found a community of artists including Daisy Youngblood, Joe Haske, Robert Israel and Cara Perlman who lived in the same building and Bernice Rubin who lived in the neighborhood. In 1976 Callard moved to the top floor of 40 Lispenard St. She, Cara Perlman, and Bernice Rubin acquired a net lease for the upper three floors and renovated the building.</p><p>Andrea Callard's involvement in creating the artist group Collaborative Projects Inc. was one of Callard's strongest contributions to the New York art community. The organization mimiced corporate structure in an attempt to garner large grants that the organization then redistributed among its members or used for collaborative projects such as television programs. In addition, Colab created art opportunities by organizing a wealth of art shows in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Finally, Colab actively sought to collaborate with other fringe art groups, most notably Fashion Moda in the South Bronx, resulting in what Lucy Lippard calls unprecedented and "fragile cross-class, cross cultural alliances". Colab embodied a rough and highly political art scene that deviated from contemporary art spaces and production practices. Andrea Callard served as Secretary to the group from 1978-1980.</p><p>Andrea Callard's professional career also took off during this time period. In addition to numerous contributions to Colab shows, Andrea Callard created a great deal of individual artworks including photography, drawings, and watercolors. Her artwork centered on issues of environmentalism, which is particularly evident in her Ailanthus series. Additionally, her work attended to issues of cultural change evident in her contribution to the 1979 Custom and Culture II show at the NYC Customs House. In 1977 the National Endowment for the Arts, (NEA) awarded her an Individual Artist's Fellowship for Drawing. She also participated in several art residencies beginning in 1978 at the Cummington Community for the Arts in Cummington, Massachusetts. Finally, Andrea Callard became very involved in the LINE organization, a group focused on re-granting monies for artists' books.</p><p>In the 1980s Callard gradually separated from Colab but continued to look for opportunities to collaborate with other artists. This desire manifests in her 1980 Site, Cite, Sight show with Bonnie O'Neill in San Francisco, her collaboration with Kathy High on a street poster for Colab, her contributions to Steve Ning's film "Freckled Rice" and her work with Sam Sue on "The Tenement: Place for Survival, Object of Reform" in 1988. These projects are notable but represent only a portion of Callard's collaborations throughout the 1980s. Additionally, Callard participated in several art education residencies including one in Malone, New York, at the Hecksher Museum, at the Huntington Public Library, at Carthage Central Schools in Black River New York, at Studio in the Schools, at Rockland Center for the Arts and at the Baldwinsville Schools.</p><p>The 1990 and early 2000s continued to be productive years for Andrea Callard. She contributed to a number of group shows and held some solo shows including an exhibition at the Storefront for Art and Architecture entitled "The Waste Stream:" and a display of master printer's portfolios titled "Multiple Connections" at the Bronx River Art Center. She also participated in several residencies and visiting artist positions including one at the American Academy in Rome, Italy. Finally, she took on leadership roles as Art Coordinator for the National Council of Jewish Women, Director of Arts and Crafts at Brnat Lake Camp, and Project Arts Coordinator at the New York City Board of Education.</p><p>Andrea Callard continues to live and work in New York City.</p>  </bioghist>

The series is divided into seven subseries. Time and place figure strongly in the organization of this series because they were organizing principles in Callard's organization of her papers.</p><p>Subseries A includes materials dated before 1973 such as items relating to her undergraduate work at San Francisco Art Institute. Subseries B reflects Callard's early years in New York city at 150 Chambers St. Artists Daisy Youngblood, Joe Haske, Robert Israel and Cara Perlman also lived in this building. Materials with specific years appear at the beginning of this subseries in chronological order. Materials designated "150 Chambers St" or "1973-1976" but without a specific date are grouped at the end of the subseries. Subseries C includes art works from Callard's first three years in her loft on the top floor of 40 Lispenard Street. Callard, Cara Perlman and Bernice Rubin secured a net lease for the top three floors of this guilding in 1976 and renovated the building. This subseries also includes work related to Callard's 1978 residency at the Cummington, Massachusetts Community for the Arts, her Ailanthus project, as well as her contributions to Colab's Dog Show and the Batman show. Subseries D includes materials relating to Callard's art career such as her contributions to the Custom and Culture II show, Colab's Animals Living in the City and the Times' Square Show as well as Callard's work with Bonnie O'Neill at Site, Cite, Sight in San Francisco. Subseries E again contains art files related to Andrea Callard's professional career including her contribution in the NYC Wildlife Museum, Inside/out garden signs at the Bronx River Art Center and Colab's Talk is Cheap street posters. Subseries F includes materials relating to Callard's art career particularly her collaboration with Sam Sue on the installation "The Tenement: Place of Survival, Object of Reform." This work appeared at the Chinatown History Project in 1988 and as part of the DIA Art Foundation "If you lived here" exhibition. Subseries G contains materials relating to Callard's art career. Most notably, the series includes work relating to her "Home Turf" window at Art in General and her storefront exhibit at Art and Architecture. The subseries also includes black and white contact sheets and negatives as well as materials relating to collaborative works during this timeperiod. Subseries H contains materials relating to Callard's work as an art teacher such as student letters, photographs and press clippings from artist in residency programs as well as teaching opportunities in New York City. Subseries I includes undated materials. Contact sheets and negatives taken by Andrea Callard compose the majority of this subseries.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref100" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries A: 1950-1973</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/479475</unitid></did><c id="aspace_ref101" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Color slides, 1966-1973</unittitle><unitid>cuid22160</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/479476</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">1966-1973</unitdate><container altrender="Box Binder (2&quot;
