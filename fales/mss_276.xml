<p>The Paper Tiger Television Archive was donated to NYU's Fales Library by the Paper Tiger Television Collective in 2010. Accretions were donated in 2016 by Julie Ludwig, Paper Tiger Television, and in 2018 by Marisa Holmes. Further accretions were donated in 2019.</p><p>http://papertiger.org/, http://blog.papertiger.org/, and http://papertigertv.blogspot.com/ were initially selected by Tamiment curators and captured through the use of The California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service in circa 2007-2009 as part of the Alternative Mass Media / News Web Sites Web Archive. In November 2015, these websites were migrated to Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In 2015, these seeds were transferred to the Fales Library. In 2018, http://weinterruptthisprogram.org/  was added. The accession number associated with this website is 2019.057.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Paper Tiger Television is a New York-based public access video collective. Co-founded by DeeDee Halleck in 1981, Paper Tiger TV was the first nationally distributed public access television program. Its programming critiques media corporatization and censorship, covering issues such as racism, sexism, economic inequality, and U.S. imperialism. Episodes often follow the format of a guest scholar reading and critiquing a piece of mainstream media, such as Paper Tiger TV's earliest programs featuring Herb Schiller critiquing <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph>. Frequent guests include Herb Schiller, Brian Winston, Tuli Kupferberg, Noam Chomsky, Amy Goodman, and Joel Kovel.</p><p>In 1986, Paper Tiger TV founded Deep Dish Television, the first grassroots satellite network in the United States. From 1986 to 2018, Deep Dish TV produced work by independent videomakers, programmers, and social activists on a variety of cultural and political topics. Deep Dish TV collaborated with Paper Tiger TV on the <emph render="italic">Gulf Crisis TV Project</emph>, a ten-part series exploring many aspects of the Gulf War.</p><p>In addition to being broadcasted nationally on public access channels, Paper Tiger's programs have been shown internationally in screenings and installations. Installations in this collection include "Dream House" at the Wexner Center for the Arts, 1991; "Smashing Myths of the Information Age" at the San Francisco Art Institute, 1992; and the "Being the Media: Designing a New Rrradical Media" Conference in New York, 2012.</p><p>Paper Tiger TV has a history of advocacy in and outside of their television programming. Members of the collective have organized workshops and programs, distributed educational resources on video production, and collaborated with youth in New York City to produce programs such as "Homecoming Queens" (1999), "Access Orbit" (2001), "Biorhythms" (2002), "On the Real" (2002), "War and the Economy" (2002), and "Basta Ya!" (2010). Paper Tiger has also continuously advocated for public access programming, and has long standing relationships with other independent media organizations such as the Manhattan Neighborhood Network, <emph render="italic">Democracy Now!</emph>, and the Alliance for Community Media.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>In 2014, the Paper Tiger Television archived website was added to Tamiment Library Web Collection on Organizations (WEB ARC 003). Crawling of the websites in this collection were ceased in 2018. In 2022, archived websites associated with this collection in the Alternative Mass Media / News Web Sites Web Archive were shared to the Paper Tiger Television Web Archive in Archive-It for access and replay purposes. </p><p>The original collection was processed by an archivist in 2012. Video recordings were processed by an archivist in 2014. Additional processing information prior to 2025 was not recorded.</p><p>In 2024-2025, accessions 2016.021, 2016.042, 2019.006, and 2019.023 were processed by an archivist. The materials were divided into existing series based on the records' contents and arranged intellectually within these series. Audiovisual and digital physical media were physically arranged by format and lightly cleaned. Log sheets and notes stored within video cases were removed and stored with other paper materials.</p><p>During processing of the accretions, existing description for the rest of the collection was revised to meet current standards. Some videos that were previously digitized could not be directly matched with their analog counterparts. In these cases, the requestable digital component was attached to the parent record rather than the child analog video. Rolled posters were flattened by the Preservation Department.</p><p>25 floppy disks, and 9 optical discs were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged. New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content.</p>  </processinfo>

It also contains dubs, graphics, production elements, edits of programs, and source material such as unedited footage of events and interviews. Versions and elements of certain programs may be present in multiple places throughout the two subseries.</p><p>Paper Tiger TV's television programs critique media, culture, and politics, often inviting a guest scholar to read and critique a piece of mainstream media. Frequent guests include Herb Schiller, Brian Winston, Tuli Kupferberg, Noam Chomsky, Amy Goodman, and Joel Kovel. In addition to the U.S. media, Paper Tiger's programs cover the topics of women's rights, U.S. elections, the Iraq War and the Gulf War, the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, the World Trade Organization, the prison industrial complex, and gentrification. Many programs were produced in collaboration with New York City youth, including "Homecoming Queens" (1999), "Access Orbit" (2001), "Biorhythms" (2002), "On the Real" (2002), "War and the Economy" (2002), and "Basta Ya!" (2010).

From 2009-2015, the website was captured more consistently, and contains information on their many projects and video series, such as the Paper Tiger Reads Working Women, Surveilling Surveillance, Urban Environmentalism: DIY Living Green, Gentrification in Sunset Park, Military Myths, production on the Peace Pentagon, Public Spaces, Exposing Deception, social movements, Detroit, fast food workers strike, and El Taller Latino Americano. The website also contained information with descriptions of their historical programs and information on their weekly Wednesday broadcasts. Their blog contained descriptions of their programs,  dating back to 2007 as well as events listings and some behind the scenes information. Video topics included art, community gardens, democracy and dissent, DIY and grassroots media, feminism, education, environment, events, free speech and censorship, science and technology, globalization, health, immigration, labor, LGTBQIA+, media criticism, peace and conflict, politics, pop culture, public space, race and class, science and technology, social movements, urban politics, women, consumerism and capitalism, and youth. In circa 2016-2017, the website redesigned to highlight the Paper Tiger archives (both images and video) and their more recent work dating until 2021. They also were a frequent collaborator with Deep Dish Television, on projects related to Mumia Abu-Jamal and organizing against "white nationalism, neoliberalism, patriarchy, and colonialism" after the election of President Donald Trump.</p></scopecontent></c></dsc>
