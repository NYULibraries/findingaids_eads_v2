    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Guerrilla TV Archive primarily reflects Deirdre Boyle's research for the book <emph render="italic">Subject to Change: Guerrilla Television Revisited</emph>. The guerrilla TV movement began in the late 1960s with the commercial release and marketing of the portable video camera. The archive documents the growing accessiblity of video technology and the rise of video collectives committed to using videotape as an artistic, storytelling, documentary, and socially transforming medium. Additionally, the archive shows the development of video preservation concerns, the rise of video collections within public and academic research libraries and the connections between underground video, cable and corporate television networks.</p><p> The archive is particularly rich in personal interviews between Deirdre Boyle and many influential individuals such as Skip Blumberg, Allen Rucker, Wendy Apple, and Michael Shamberg, who were involved in video collectives such as Top Value Television (TVTV), the Videofreex, New Orleans Public Access Cable, and Broadside TV, among many others. The materials span the mid-1960s through the early 1990s offering a comprehensive view of the guerrilla tv movement and activist media, in general, through interviews, articles, publications, photographs and publicity materials.</p><p> Documentary film and video, as an activist genre, is also reflected in the collection through interviews with John Reilly and Julie Gustafson of Global Village, programs for documentary film festivals as well as interviews with filmmaker George Stoney. Another strength of the collection is documentation of the development of video technology. The archive contains materials that document and publicize developments in portable video technology, including materials relating to satellite technology, videotaping and editing, the beginnings of cable television and numerous manuals, magazines and catalogues reflecting the cutting edge of video technology of the time. </p><p> The collection also contains a small amount of materials relating to Deirdre Boyle's other interests in video and film. These materials include festival catalogues and programs from Hong Kong Cinema, documentation of video preservation concerns and philosophy as well as video art exhibition catalogues.</p>  </scopecontent>
