    <abstract id="aspace_91df1331111d2a055ba41dc328969c70">Visual AIDS is a New York City-based contemporary arts organization committed to HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness whose mission is accomplished through projects which support artists living with the disease, as well as honor and preserve the legacies of artists who have died from this disease. This collection documents an organization formed as a reaction to the AIDS crisis during the late 1980s through the lens of the artistic community and their active response at that time and the proceeding decades. 
The Visual AIDS Records (1986-2025, ongoing) document the daily administrative activities of the organization since its inception in 1988, as well as documenting the organization's key initiatives including a Day With(out) Art,  Electric Blanket, and The Archive Project. Materials within this collection include archived websites, correspondence, Board meeting minutes, notes, press clippings, press kits, press clippings, memorabilia, calendars, and video and audio recordings related to events. This collection also contains promotional brochures, forms, and posters for exhibitions, benefit events, and general programming,  as well as collectible broadside graphic art posters created by various artists which were distributed to organizations and used as a promotional tool for the organization. A small selection of individual artists' files contained in this collection typically include artist statements, press clippings, resumes, as well as artwork images in the form of slides and photographs.</abstract>

    <head>Appraisal</head>
<p>In January 2022, curators reappraised and discarded a suitcase that arrived with the collection.</p><p>In 2025, the following were removed from the collection during processing: duplicates of publications, fliers, and press clippings; 2 t-shirts; 2 bowling shirts; 5 cloth tote bags; 88 VHS, 3 DVD, 2 U-Matic, 2 audiocassettes (these were either off-air or commercial recordings); and 19 born-digital carriers (duplicates of existing paper material in the collection). 
Multiple packets of lube and condoms were removed from the collection at the suggestion of conservators due to the fact that these items were not unique and that they had the possibility of damaging nearby items if their enclosures were to rupture. 
A small number of artists' individual files were removed from the collection after notes within the files indicated they did not wish their files to remain in the collection.</p>  </appraisal>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Decisions made prior to the collection's arrival at New York University are unknown. Many boxes arrived at NYU underfilled or overfilled, requiring all of the collection's original folders to be placed in new, acid-free boxes and requiring the box-level inventory provided by the donor to be updated. A number of oversized materials were also relocated to larger, flat boxes and shelving units, and slide projector equipment was removed from the collection. During rehousing, all materials were surveyed and described, including audio-visual materials. Excessive duplicate materials, including some ephemera and clippings, were removed in order to be offered back to the donor.  
<lb/> <lb/>
In 2022-2024, the archived websites were added to the resource record.
<lb/> <lb/>
In 2025 paper material was placed in acid-free folders and manuscript boxes. Oversized material was foldered and housed appropriately according to its size. The "Play Smart" trading card packets were assessed by conservators and the condoms and lube packets were removed from the collection due to the potential of their deterioration and subsequent damage to paper in the collection. The trading cards were foldered and appropriately housed. Audiovisual material was labeled and individually listed in the inventory.
<lb/> <lb/>
The majority of the physical audiovisual material were identified as commercial recordings, off-air recordings, or outside the scope of NYU's collecting practices and were separated from the collection. The retained audiovisual material were numbered, labeled, and listed individually within their appropriate series inventory. 
<lb/> <lb/>
20  optical discs were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit.

The series includes promotional materials produced by Visual AIDS, such as press releases, funding requests, graphic logo designs, print advertisements, press clippings, correspondence, planning notes, and posters, many of which were utilized by the participating institutions. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
Additionally, the series contains materials focused on the institutions and organizations registered to participate in A Day With(out) Art through their own events, exhibitions, and activities. Materials include completed registration forms detailing the participant's events, as well as press clippings, photographs, and promotional items such as flyers, posters, and information sheets. For certain years, participant materials are further organized by specific cities or states, in addition to general event promotion files.
<lb/>
<lb/>
This series also documents A Night Without Light, a companion event to A Day With(out) Art in which business and institutions turn out the lights in their buildings for 15 minutes on December 1 to commemorate the day. Materials for this event include promotional flyers, completed participant forms, and information kits, as well as photographs and postcard images. Proclamations from New York City honoring A Day With(out) Art and A Night Without Light over multiple years are also included. Additionally, the series contains the <emph render="italic">Every Ten Minutes</emph> recording created by Robert Farber for Visual AIDS in connection with A Day With(out) Art, as well as videos containing a public service announcement featuring students and a participant event.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_a665efb52d42b9d218e1b77accc3d120" level="file"><did><unittitle>Event Staff List</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/1021623</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1989/1989">1989</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
