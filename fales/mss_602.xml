    <abstract id="aspace_6b067812e6f41e36be76508735339a9c">Michael Fesco (1934-2019) was a Broadway dancer and major figure in New York City's gay nightlife scene.  From 1974 to 1981, he owned and managed The Flamingo, New York City's first exclusively gay disco. The club was located at the corner of Houston and Broadway and was only open to club members. In addition to regular dance nights, The Flamingo hosted themed parties with elaborate set pieces and themed decor. After closing The Flamingo in 1981, Fesco remained active in the gay nightlife scene and hosted events at other venues, including Studio 54. The Michael Fesco Papers (dated 1958-2007,  bulk dates 1974-1982) document Fesco's career in theater and nightlife. The bulk of the materials are related to The Flamingo and document the club's origins, annual theme parties, and eventual closure in 1981. These materials include photographs, posters, correspondence, invitations, member newsletters, an audio recording, and a small selection of artifacts, including buttons, matches, and a lighter. Fesco's Broadway career is documented with correspondence, a handbill, and one scrapbook, and his post-Flamingo work in nightlife is documented by posters, invitations, and a second scrapbook.</abstract>

<p>At the time of accessioning, materials were rehoused in archival boxes and folders, maintaining their original order. Oversized items were removed from their frames. Materials were described on the collection-level with a box-level inventory.</p><p>In 2024, an archivist grouped materials by topic, arranged them chronologically, and assigned file titles. Unnecessary Mylar enclosures were removed and slides were housed in protective sheets. Small paper items, such as membership cards and raffle tickets, were placed in acid-free envelopes within folders. Folded materials were unfolded and placed in appropriately sized housing. Materials in a scrapbook were removed from the scrapbook pockets and placed in archival folders, but are described as one intellectual file. Oversized newsprint and ephemera were sent to preservation for housing, and audio media was labeled with individual identifiers. Actor's Equity contracts that contained personal identifiable information were photocopied and the photocopies were redacted and retained in the collection. The original contracts were discarded. </p><p>Due to deaccessions in 2025, Box 2 was removed from the collection.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Michael Fesco (1934-2019) was a Broadway dancer and major figure in New York City's gay nightlife scene. He moved to New York City in 1958 to study ballet and worked as a dancer in Broadway productions.  In 1969, he took a summer job working at a nightclub in Cherry Grove on Fire Island, where he later designed and opened the Ice Palace. At the Ice Palace, Fesco focused on dance music and regularly employed DJs, something that was unusual at the time.  He also created the "tea dance" to attract customers to the club on typically slow Sunday afternoons. In 1973, he decided to focus on gay nightlife in Manhattan, and he opened The Flamingo in 1974, where he continued to employ DJs, host regular dance nights, and produce themed parties until 1981. The Flamingo was a members-only club located on the corner of Houston and Broadway and was one of the first discos explicitly created for gay men. Fesco did freelance event planning and promotion both before and after operating The Flamingo, using the company name "Michael Fesco Presents" in the 1970s and "Michael Fesco Productions" beginning in the 1980s. He had long-term relationships with the singing group Labelle and drag performer Lynne Carter, both of whom he worked with throughout the 1970s and 1980s under both company names. In the early 1980s, many Michael Fesco Presents parties were at Studio 54, and Fesco later planned parties at other clubs, including Club West End and The Roxy. He also created "Sea Tea" parties in the late 1990s, which were tea dances held on boats sailing around Manhattan. In addition to tea dances, Fesco planned annual Halloween, Christmas, New Year's Eve, and season opening and closing parties, as well as parties with themes including "Tropicana," "Tattooed Cowboy," "Black Party," "White Party," "Follies," and "Carnival."</p>  </bioghist>
