    <head>Biographical  Note</head>
<p>Tony Martin was born in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1937. He studied at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and The Art Institute of Chicago. A painter from the outset, Martin is one of the first artists to use light as a medium, often incorporating light compositions and visual projections into musical performances and interactive installations. He is a recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts Individual Artist Fellowship, and has worked regularly with such composers as Pauline Oliveros, Morton Subotnick and David Tudor. </p><p>Martin makes works that engage the viewer as a participant. This interest in interactivity began in 1962 with his first multisensory environmental piece, "Theater For Walkers, Talkers, Touchers" (1962); this work, as well as current works, apply principles of resonance and feedback through photo and proximity electronics. Martin has collaborated with David Tudor for the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, created work for the E.A.T. Pepsi Pavilion at Expo 70, in Osaka, Japan, and has exhibited his work at galleries and museums worldwide.</p><p>In 1993, Martin helped co-found The Painting Center, with the aim of providing exhibition space to both emerging and mature painters pursuing various formal directions. </p><p>Sources:</p><p>- http://www.tonymartin.us/index.html</p><p>
