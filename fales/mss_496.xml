    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Beginning in 2014, Kent Underwood and Robin Preiss selected websites related to contemporary composers. From 2017-2018, Bess Pittman and Caroline Oliveira accessioned and described the majority of the collection and created the finding aid. Beginning in October 2018, the collection was maintained by Nicole Greenhouse. Maintenance of the collection includes rescoping due to missing captured content; redirects and content drift; missing embedded materials (such as videos or attached Google documents and PDFs); and other materials created by the selected composers. From 2023-2025, student workers Lizzy Zarate and Mercedes Rodrigues Lima wrote additional description and standardized description across the entire collection. Additional administrative description was added by Nicole Greenhouse. In 2025, the finding aid was edited by Mercedes Rodrigues Lima to include updated descriptions of the composers and their websites.</p>  </processinfo>

<p>The New York University Collection of Contemporary Composers' Websites (2014-ongoing) consists of a selection of websites produced and operated by contemporary composers for the promotion of their work and careers. "Contemporary" is defined as living or, in a few cases, very recently deceased. "Composers" is defined as creative musicians who are working within, are descending from, or are in some significant way connected to the Western traditions of concert music; this includes composers who produce notated scores plus those whose work embraces improvisation, collaborative composition, and other post-modern/post-classical creative practices. The sites typically include biographical data; calendars of performances; catalogs of scores and recordings; and embedded audio and video. Capture of the sites began in 2014 and is ongoing.</p>  </scopecontent>
