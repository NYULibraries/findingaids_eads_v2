    <abstract id="aspace_17a8987b7ce67df8b199122e758d5209">Hot Peaches was a drag theater company founded in 1972 by writer and performer Jimmy Camicia. The group was known for their collaborative interactions with other drag performance groups and queer revolutionaries, including cast member Marsha P. Johnson. The group was based in New York City and performed shows regularly from the 1970s to the early 2000s not only in New York clubs, but also tours in Europe. Hot Peaches was often a platform for cast members' self-expression, as well as a nurturing queer community. The Hot Peaches Records contain material connected to their performances including scripts; press clippings; show production work books; digital and analog performance recordings; cast and performance photographs; and promotional announcements and posters. This collection also contains personal material created by Jimmy Camicia including school ephemera, writings, and journals dating from the late 1950s to 2012.</abstract>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Hot Peaches was a theater company working mostly in drag in New York City during the 1970s to the early 2000s. The company was founded by Jimmy Camicia in 1972, who befriended a group of drag queens in New York and was inspired to write shows for them to perform. Self-defined as as gay theater group, the Hot Peaches created shows that expressed the gay experience with a campy and political twist. Early shows were known for the castmembers' costumes, which often included vibrant, sparkling glam outfits with liberal use of platform boots, glitter, and feather boas. Camicia almost exclusively wrote the scripts, and the shows were put on three to five times per year at a variety of small theaters in Manhattan including Peach Pitts, Theater for the New City, La Mama, and Theater Genesis. The group would also occasionally do European tours, performing in England, Amsterdam, Scotland, Italy, and Germany, often providing their audiences with an experience that was not necessarily available for the gay communities in these countries. Notable cast members include the activist and performer Marsha P. Johnson, Sister Tooey, Wilhelmina Ross, Ian McKay, and Split Britches founder Peggy Shaw.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Material was placed in acid-free folders and boxes. Overstuffed folders were separated and placed in multiple folders when necessary. Show production files were removed from their three-ring binders and placed in file folders, retaining the material in their original order.
Rolled posters from shows were sent to the Preservation Lab for housing. One audio reel and four journals with mold were identified and treated by the Preservation lab. A mounted poster, ledger book, and two scrapbooks were transferred to the Preservation Lab for treatment and returned.
Four digital disks were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
In September 2023 a processing archivist accessioned an accretion totaling 2 linear feet, which was immediately added to the existing collection. Material was placed in acid-free folders and boxes, and titles were added to titles within the existing inventory, or when necessary, new titles were created.</p>  </processinfo>

Files in this series are organized by date and show title, with these files typically containing promotional fliers, show programs, and sheet music. Loose photographs in this series include promotional cast portraits, still images from shows, and backstage candid shots.

Select shows in this series contain production work books which encompass the entire process of creating that show. These work books were created for a portion of the New York shows, but also more detailed work books for select European tours. Work books for the local productions typically contain notated scripts, cast lists, notes, stage directions, photographs, schedules, press clippings, brief journal entries, and costume and set sketches. European tour work book files contain much of the same material as the local production work books, with the addition of travel information and schedules. 
The series also contains a 1981 Master's thesis on the history of Hot Peaches written by a former cast member. Digital files containing photographs and text used on the Hot Peaches website from 2008-2009 are also in this series. 
Information on Hot Peaches cast member and gay liberation activist Marsha P Johnson can be found throughout this series dating from the 1970s until her death in the early 1990s. Show scripts without notations can be found in Series II.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_86e3af11b799bc1b450d83c0e93a2391" level="file"><did><unittitle>Photographs -- Cast Members, Shows</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/971667</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1970/1998" type="inclusive">1970-1998</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

This series also contains Bard College publications from the mid-1960s, including <emph render="italic">Gesamtwerk</emph> and <emph render="italic">Bard Psychology Journal</emph> of which Camicia served as editor and writer. Other published material in this series includes a poetry book <emph render="italic">The Divas of Sheridan Square</emph> which Camicia eventually adapted into a Hot Peaches show, and his 2013 book <emph render="italic">My Dear, Sweet Self: A Hot Peach Life</emph> which recounts Camicia's early life and the history of Hot Peaches. This series also contains articles written by Camicia about his experiences performing and traveling in Europe with the Hot Peaches cast. His loose poetry and a mock-up of a children's book are also in this series. Documentation related to Camicia's struggle with his landlord to maintain his rent-controlled apartment in New York provides insight into the struggles facing an artist and his housing issues during the 1980s and 1990s. This series also contains a small collection of Camicia's correspondence from the mid-1970s and 1990s.

An extensive collection of Camicia's journals are in this series dating from the 1950s to 2012 that often contain not only diary entries, but photographs; press clippings; sketches of portraits, costumes, and sets; and writing notes and ideas. These journals explore Camicia's early life while still in school, traveling in Europe as a young man, the development of Hot Peaches, relationships with cast members, and critiques on Hot Peaches shows. These journals also document the viewpoint of a gay performer and writer living in New York during the 1970s-2000s, as well as the experimental theater scene, the gay community in the West Village, and the drag and gay club scenes.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_8223eb8dba053ae7f0221e584c9ede21"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged by item type and chronologically within those groupings.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_789494f6f6b87d2776ff57386841d758" level="file"><did><unittitle>Scrapbook -- Jimmy Camicia and Hot Peaches</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/971743</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1950/1979" type="inclusive">1950s-1979</unitdate><container altrender="Flat Box -
