    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Jazz musician, composer, artist, and educator William (Bill) Robert Dixon was born in Nantucket, Massachusetts in 1925. Around the age of seven, he and his family moved to Harlem, New York. Dixon studied painting at Boston University, the WPA Arts School, and the Art Students League, working in a variety of mediums. Dixon served in the Army during World War II in Germany from 1944-1946, and later studied music at the Hartnett Conservatory of Music from 1946-1951 where he played trumpet, flugelhorn, and piano. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
While living in New York in the 1950s, Dixon worked as an international civil servant at the United Nations and helped found the UN Jazz Society. Dixon also worked clubs as a performing musician in Greenwich Village during this time. In 1964, Dixon organized and produced a four-day festival of underexposed talent, the October Revolution in Jazz, including music and discussions, which led to him founding the short-lived cooperative organization of creative improvising New York musicians known as the Jazz Composers Guild. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
In 1966, he began a collaborative partnership with dancer and choreographer Judith Dunn, which eventually led to him joining the faculty at Bennington College as a professor. Dixon founded the Black Music Division in the 1970s at Bennington. He assembled and led the Division's faculty and wrote the curriculum until his retirement from Bennington in 1995. While at Bennington, he taught classes in a variety of related subjects including improvisation, composition, and performance. He was director of the Black Music Ensemble. From 1971-1972, Dixon was a visiting professor of Music at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He retired from Bennington College in 1996.
<lb/>
<lb/>
In addition to his work as an educator, Dixon continued to record music and perform among other improvisational jazz musicians. He played alongside Archie Shepp, Cecil Taylor, William Parker and other musicians of the avant-garde jazz scene. He worked for fifty years as a recording artist, crafting solo music for trumpet, ensemble, dance collaborations, and orchestras. He recorded with record labels RCA, Cadence Jazz Records, and Soul Note, and founded his own publishing company, Metamorphosis Music. In 1967, he composed and conducted a score for the United States Information Agency film <emph render="italic">The Wealth of a Nation,</emph> produced and directed by William Greaves. In 1980, Dixon completed his first tour in Italy, where he would return to record the albums <emph render="italic">In Italy, Vol I and II</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Considerations, Vol I</emph> and <emph render="italic">II</emph>. In 2007, Dixon recorded <emph render="italic">17 Musicians in Search of a Sound: Darfur</emph> at the New York City Vision Festival to bring attention to the genocide of Sudan's South Darfur region.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Dixon was also an artist working in various mediums including painting, printmaking, drawing, and collage. He often used his visual art on album covers. As an author, he published the book <emph render="italic">L'Opera: A Collection of Letters, Writings, Musical Scores, Drawings, and Photographs</emph> in 1986. He also wrote reviews and articles, and contributed to other books about jazz.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Bill Dixon passed away in 2010.</p>  </bioghist>

and Contents</head><p>This subseries contains paper and digital files related to Bill Dixon as a musician and composer during the 1960s to the 2000s including the creation of his musical albums, original musical works, and performances.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Dixon recorded albums from the early 1960s to 2009. Files related to these albums in this subseries include liner note drafts, recording session notes, album publicity material, and mock-ups and images for albums, some of which contain Dixon's original artwork. 
This subseries also contains images, ephemera, and program notes related to Dixon's performances as a solo performer and in groups including the 1966 Newport Jazz Festival with dancer Judith Dunn, the orchestra practice for Dixon's original soundtrack for the movie <emph render="italic">Wealth of a Nation</emph>, and University of the Streets performances and rehearsals. Files in this subseries also include information on tours and jazz festivals throughout Italy, Germany, Israel, France, and Canada during the 1980s through 2000s. Musicians Dixon often toured with include Tony Oxley, Cecil Taylor, Mario Pavone, and Laurence Cook.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Dixon's work as a composer is documented through a large collection of handwritten music manuscripts and program notes on individual works including "Autumn Sequences, from A Paris Diary: Fall 1976", "For Franz", "For Cecil Taylor", "Index: A Work for Large Ensemble", "Letters: Round Up the Usual Suspects", "Metamorphosis", and "Winter Song, 1964". A portion of the music manuscripts are untitled and include new compositions and exercises for student ensembles.
<lb/>
<lb/>
The subseries also contains a small collection of files accumulated on the publishing companies Dixon used, including BMI, EMI, IREC, and his own company, Metamorphosis. These files typically include correspondence and reports regarding music rights, royalties, and album production. Heavily annotated reference books on trumpet performance and composition are also in this subseries.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_37f7afdd8c16979af04ebda43228dcb5"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This subseries is arranged chronologically, within groupings of files.

Founding documentation of the Division includes reports, memos, and writings by Dixon. A report from the Black Music Division Visiting Committee dating from 1979 to 1981 provides an overview of the Division and their findings. Division meeting material in this subseries includes audio recordings, minutes, and notes. Dixon's administrative files contain budgets, correspondence, and memos related to the Division. Lecture notes, syllabi, recording transcripts, along with reading and listening lists for Dixon's classes and music lessons are in this subseries.
Black Music Division Ensemble and other Bennington College event ephemera and planning files contain programs, promotional posters, correspondence, and notes. Work files for the Black Music Division's short-lived journal, <emph render="italic">Manuscript: Journal of the New Black Music</emph>, contain meeting minutes, writing submissions, correspondence, drafts, and mock-ups from 1974 to 1975. 
This subseries contains images of rehearsals, performances, college buildings, Bill Dixon, and fellow professors Stephen Horenstein, Sonny Brown, Arthur Brooks, and Nadi Qamar interacting with students. This subseries also contains completed questionnaires, most likely distributed by Dixon to faculty, students, and administrators, to test their knowledge of Black Music from the mid-1940s to the 1970s.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ea8233c7912c7705cd13f2d3234469d0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Meetings -- Preparation for Spring Music Festival</unittitle><unitid>cuid38751</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/962881</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1966-11-16/1966-11-16">November 16, 1966</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_a495c2899ae887287a2b4ab2cef29dc9" label="Audio [31142063259934]" type="Box">55</container><container id="aspace_7c9d9e60edeb80044594009c0b2ec503" parent="aspace_a495c2899ae887287a2b4ab2cef29dc9" type="Quarter_Inch_Audio_Reel">481_1380</container></did></c><c id="aspace_8e4d2a167dcf637de3427be399db7b3a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Meetings -- A Compilation</unittitle><unitid>cuid38752</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/962882</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1970/1981" type="inclusive">1970-1981</unitdate><container altrender="Flat Box -

Original artworks in this series include photography, collage, prints, painting, and drawings. Many of his ink and pencil drawings in this series were rendered on envelopes, concert programs, and Bennington College meeting minutes and memos. Files in this series often contain a combination of artworks, reproductions, and source material stored as they were originally in his studio. Objects in this series relating to the creation of these works include printing blocks, an etching plate, and linoleum block sheets. Dixon would often use printed images of his artworks to create collages. These reproductions and collages are in this series. Exhibition-related files, sketchbooks, and promotional presentation books are also in this series. One notable project was with URDLA (Union Regionale pour le Development de la Lithnographie d'Art) in Lyon, France in January and February 1994 where works on paper created previously by Dixon were produced as lithographs and shown in various exhibitions. This series contains correspondence, notes, and images of this process and the finished works. His artworks were not only shown in exhibitions and sold to collectors, but also used for his album covers. Files on these albums can be found in Series I.C.</p><p>Dixon wrote articles, reviews, book contributions, and liner notes for fellow musicians' albums dating from the 1950s to the 2000s. Many of his writings pertain to his experiences as a jazz musician, compositions, and relationships with other musicians. This series contains original publications as well as work files on many of his writings. Work files for his book <emph render="italic">L'Opera: A Collection of Letters, Writings, Musical Scores, Drawings, and Photographs (1967-1986)</emph> contain notes, drafts, mock-ups, correspondence, and the book itself. Also of note are his writings regarding his partnership with the choreographer Judith Dunn with whom he collaborated in the 1960s and 1970s.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_8f51c0eb7c76f6175987d73b0a7b4e32" level="file"><did><unittitle>Drawing Highlights</unittitle><unitid>cuid38994</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/964840</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1960/2010" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_462207ac30c913ec22feee25290d0bc8" label="video [31142067191653]" type="Box">70</container><container id="aspace_c3bc700c0a8e03546b79f43d7a3a7c0c" parent="aspace_462207ac30c913ec22feee25290d0bc8" type="VHS">481_1135</container><dao xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:href="https://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/material-request-placeholder" xlink:role="video-reading-room" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Drawing Highlights" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Drawing Highlights</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_1230ef72eaa56b95630792182ee385c0"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Duration: 12 minutes</p></phystech></c><c id="aspace_352a992aba272568271bb19b54a4926c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Original Artwork, Reproductions, and Source Material</unittitle><unitid>cuid40124</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/963178</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1969/2010" type="inclusive">1969-2010</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

Images also include his children, partner Sharon Vogel, friends, travel, and interior and exterior views of his home. Home movies recorded by Dixon portray his daily life, including time spent in the city with his son.</p><p>Dixon's correspondence in this series is a mixture of both personal and professional, providing a decade by decade view into Dixon's work and relationships dating from the 1960s through the 2000s. Files contain news from friends and fellow musicians, invitations for appearances and performances, album recording issues, event logistics, feedback to journalistic writings, and advice to former students and fans. This series also contains individual correspondence files including family members, collaborators, and friends including Judith Dunn, Milo Fine, Stephen Horenstein, Ted Joans, Tony Oxley, Ben Young, and Jason Zappa. Press clippings in this series cover both his personal and professional life dating from the 1940s to the 2000s, including a special edition of <emph render="italic">All About Jazz-New York</emph> after Dixon's death.
 
This series also contains files on scholarly works in which Dixon is the subject, and interviews in which Dixon provided information on his work and life. Files typically contain notes, drafts, completed copies of thesis or dissertations, and interview recordings and transcripts. Of note is a project by Bennington College student Steven Albahari from the late 1970s which includes videos of interviews with Dixon and his colleagues as well as recordings of concerts. This series also includes video excerpts of Dixon concerts, appearances, lectures, and other projects, dating from 1965 to 1995.</p><p>Dixon's datebooks, address books, resumes, biographical sketches, notes and to-do lists, and membership cards including his New York City cabaret card from 1960 are in this series.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_8054b6833def7eb5fa669f2b8df48ae6"
