    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Lucy Thane Riot Grrrl Collection predominantly consists of video and audio recordings made by Lucy Thane in March and April 1993, during the tour of Riot Grrrl bands Bikini Kill and Huggy Bear in the United Kingdom. It also contains video recordings of associated bands and people. The collection spans the years 1993 to 1995, and forms the raw footage from which Lucy Thane created the film It Changed My Life.</p><p>Bikini Kill (from Olympia, Washington) consisted of vocalist Kathleen Hanna, guitarist Billy Karren, bassist Kathi Wilcox, and drummer Tobi Vail. Members of Huggy Bear (from Brighton, England) were Niki Elliott, Karen Hill, Jo Johnson, Chris Rawley, and Jon Slade. The 1993 tour was organized by Liz Naylor, and was accompanied by a split Bikini Kill and Huggy Bear LP on Naylor's label Catcall Records. On February 12th, less than one month before the tour began, Huggy Bear appeared on the television show The Word and, after protesting a feature on two American models known as 'The Barbi Twins,' were removed from the studio. The cover of the next issue of Melody Maker on February 27th was dedicated to the events of February 12th, describing it as a 'riot.' </p><p>Dr Julia Downes describes Huggy Bear's performance on, and ejection from, The Word as "a key controversial event that propelled riot grrrl into the British popular consciousness." Subsequently, the March and April tour gained extensive, overwhelmingly negative, coverage in the UK press. This included "Rock Against Men Is Music To The Riot Grrrls' Ears" by Hester Matthewman in The Independent on Sunday on March 14th, and "Angry Young Women" by Caroline Sullivan in The Guardian on March 24th. On March 27th Anne Barrowclough wrote in The Daily Mail:</p><p>"They screech, they spit, they snarl, they swear. Every word they scream through the microphone is a prayer against men. When their music stops, you are left with a pounding head, buzzing ear drums and no doubt that Men are The Enemy. Meet the Riot Grrrls, the latest, nastiest phenomenon to enter the British music scene."</p><p>The shows themselves were all sold out and were a transformative experience for many attendees. Jen Denitto of the band Linus has said that the tour "was probably one of the bigger events that would have promoted the idea [of riot grrrl in the UK]." Furthermore, Dr Julia Downes writes that it provided "crucial spaces for the introduction of strategies to resist and reorder gender power relations within British indie music culture."</p><p>The March and April 1993 recordings consist of live concert footage, backstage footage, interviews with band members, post-show interviews with fans, and interviews with associated people, for example Liz Naylor of Catcall Records and members of the band The Raincoats. Additional recordings consist of footage of and interviews with the queercore band Sister George, and footage of and interviews with female musicians in San Francisco, as well as some unidentified, unrelated content. </p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Lucy Thane was born in North London in 1967. She studied history at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, and film production at the Northern Media School in Sheffield. In 1993 Lucy started her professional career by directing <emph render="italic">Bikini Kill in the UK</emph>, documenting the British and American Riot Grrrl movement with a focus on the American band Bikini Kill. This film took Lucy to New York and San Francisco where she lived for 5 years. There she continued to make films such as <emph render="italic">She's Real, Worse than Queer</emph> in 1997, and from 1994 to 1998 worked as a staff member, curator and editor at Artists Television Access. She also taught at the Academy of Art College and continued to perform, curate, and direct several projects with a focus on feminism.<lb/><lb/>
     In 1998 Lucy returned to London and managed Sidecar Ltd., a video access and production company in East London until 2003. In 2004, Lucy researched and developed the film <emph render="italic">I'm Dancing Inside</emph>, which has not yet been realized, but which spurned an ongoing interest in dance and movement, resulting in several performances and project related to dance. She continues to direct and produce films, teach film production, curate dance and film/photography shows, and perform in varying mediums.</p>  </bioghist>

Naylor also talks about the bands re-approaching the performer-audience relationship; fanzines as a democratic and inexpensive medium; the barriers to entry into the music industry; misogyny within the music industry; the meaning of riot grrrl, and about the importance of documenting women's history.</p><p>Hanna and Naylor listen to a recording of the Bikini Kill and Huggy Bear show in Newport, Wales, and discuss abusive men in the crowd at a show at the Warehouse in Derby, England on March 15th 1993. The Newport show features an impromptu chant of 'Rebel Girl' from the crowd, as well as Hanna ejecting a man for throwing beer on other people. Hanna discusses being verbally abused at a show in Boston from a man who also punched her roadie Laura. That same man went on to murder a woman with a gun. Hanna talks about the importance of combatting misogyny at shows, since it is perpetuated by the same men who violently assault women outside of shows. Hanna and Naylor argue over the role of agents in the booking process and the nature of artistic self-management.</p><p>The tape ends with footage of Bikini Kill performing at the Bull &amp; Gate in Kentish Town, London, England on April 3rd 1993. The show features Kathleen Hanna reading a poem entitled Ragdoll, in which she argues against magazines such as NME and Melody Maker. Post-show footage in the women's bathrooms at the Bull &amp; Gate features female fans discussing the meaning of Riot Grrrl and the politics of wearing makeup.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_9c6df10be9394480b780761664cec4a4"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Format: DVD</p><p>Duration: 02:52:11</p><p>Original Format: Video 8mm</p></phystech></c><c id="aspace_ref52" level="item"><did><unittitle>Bikini Kill Sheffield University</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/541574</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">5/3/93</unitdate><container altrender="CD Box - 5.5 x 15.5" id="aspace_debb4cb49c1f3ae104a94d1dad637ba8" label="Moving Images [31142046920834]" type="Box">Shared Fales 138</container><container id="aspace_26fe1765ae15696920a405532df32010" parent="aspace_debb4cb49c1f3ae104a94d1dad637ba8" type="DVD">287.0023</container></did><phystech id="aspace_4d07e71f0fa8555c89df453ed9611090"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Format: DVD</p><p>Duration: 01:34:36</p><p>Original Format: Video 8mm</p></phystech><scopecontent id="aspace_cb2ac70d419896764f34099eaa6a2fa5"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>This video primarily consists of footage of Bikini Kill performing at the University of Sheffield in Sheffield, England on March 5th 1993.

During Bikini Kill's performance, Kathleen Hanna, Billy Karren, Tobi Vail and Kathi Wilcox swap instruments. Hanna asks all girls to come to the front of the crowd, and tells the audience that Riot Grrrl Press can offer financial support to any girls or women who are making fanzines and who want to get them printed, copied, or distributed in the United States. She also passes on a message from a girl in the crowd who wants to form a band, and discusses homophobic graffiti she saw in the bathroom.
