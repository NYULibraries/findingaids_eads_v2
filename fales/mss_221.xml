    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Sylvère Lotringer is a literary critic, cultural theorist, and filmmaker. He is best known for founding the journal <emph render="italic">Semiotext(e)</emph>, which is largely credited with introducing the work of French theorists like Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze, Paul Virilio, Félix Guattari, Michel Foucault and Jean-François Lyotard to an English-speaking audience.<lb/></p><p>Lotringer was born in Paris to Polish-Jewish immigrants. He spent the Nazi occupation of Paris as a "hidden child", later relocating with his family to Israel. He returned to Paris and studied at  the Sorbonne, where he founded the literary magazine <emph render="italic">L'Étrave</emph>. In 1964, Lotringer entered the École pratique des Hautes Études in Paris where he wrote his doctoral dissertation on Virginia Woolf's novels under the supervision of Roland Barthes and Lucien Goldmann. During this period, he organized conferences at the Maison des Lettres of the Sorbonne where he forged connections with French literary critics, sociologists and writers as well as with the Bloomsbury Group in London (Leonard Woolf, T.S. Eliot, Vita Sackville-West, David Garnet, etc.) as a freelance writer for Louis Aragon's journal <emph render="italic">Les Lettres Françaises.</emph><lb/></p><p>After teaching in Scotland, Turkey, Australia and the American Midwest, Lotringer joined the French and Comparative Literature Faculty at Columbia University in 1972, where he eventually became Professor Emeritus. In 1973, Lotringer founded the journal <emph render="italic">Semiotext(e)</emph> with a group of Columbia University graduate students. After three scholarly, bilingual issues on semiotics, Lotringer and his group organized the "Schizo-Culture" conference in 1975 at Columbia University, which featured Félix Guattari, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Jean-François Lyotard, Ronald D. Laing, Ti-Grace Atkinson, John Cage, and William S. Burroughs. In 1978, Lotringer staged "The Nova Convention," a large downtown New York event that gathered members of the American Counter Culture (from Patti Smith and Timothy Leary to Franz Zappa, Laurie Anderson and Allen Ginsberg) as an homage to William S. Burroughs.<lb/></p><p>Subsequent issues of <emph render="italic">Semiotext(e)</emph> moved away from the original scholarly format, enlisting a crew of artists and featuring experimental typographics, controversial topics and an ever-expanding cast of French theorists. In 1983, Lotringer founded <emph render="italic">Semiotext(e)</emph>emph>'s "Foreign Agents" series to present their work in a portable book format stripped of the usual academic introductions and afterwords.  In 1990, as "French Theory" became established in America, Chris Kraus added the "Native Agents" book series --  meant to present home-grown fiction writers as American counterparts to the French theorists -- to <emph render="italic">Semiotext(e)</emph>'s output. Later, Lotringer expanded <emph render="italic">Semiotext(e)</emph>'s roster to include an "Active Agents" series featuring the Black Panthers.<lb/></p><p>Lotringer directed several films, including <emph render="italic">The Golden Bowl, or, Repression</emph> (1984-1989) and <emph render="italic">How to Shoot a Crime</emph>, which were co-directed with Chris Kraus; <emph render="italic">Too Sensitive to Touch</emph> (1981), co-directed with Michael Oblowitz; and solo works <emph render="italic">Second Hand Hitler</emph> (unfinished, circa 1985), <emph render="italic">Violent Femmes</emph> (1998), and <emph render="italic">The Man Who Disappeared</emph> (2015).</p>  </bioghist>

Because this series contains both Lotringer's personal correspondence and that of Semiotext(e), it includes letters addressed to recipients other than Lotinger, such as Jim Fleming and Chris Kraus. These letters are nevertheless filed under the name of their sender. Where a sender has an important affiliation to a magazine or institution, this information has been noted in parentheses; such information is meant to be helpful but is not exhaustive. Correspondence with organizations and institutions that is business-oriented rather than personal can be found in Subseries B; however, such separations are not entirely firm. Files may include manuscripts, photographs and other material that was included with the letters. Materials in each folder are arranged chronologically, with undated materials at the end.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref787" level="file"><did><unittitle>"A"</unittitle><unitid

The issues and conferences are arranged chronologically. The three large unfinished projects--the Panic, Japan, and Flesh-Eating Technologies Issues--have been listed by approximate date range and are grouped together. Often there is significant overlap between issues and conferences, with one growing out of the other. In such cases, materials have been placed with the best fit. Among the materials you can expect to find correspondence; notes, clippings and visual source material; manuscripts; layouts; flyers; and press clippings. Materials for each issue or conference is alphabetical by folder description. Material belonging to unidentified projects is found in the last folders in the series.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2297" level="file"><did><unittitle>Issue 1 "Alternatives in Semiotics":

It contains subseries for his writing (including his book on sex offenders, Overexposed); his film projects, often in collaboration with his then-wife Chris Kraus; conferences, events and tours that he organized or participated in as an individual; academic papers, personal papers, and a subseries of notes and fragments.
