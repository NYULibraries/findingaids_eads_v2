<p>Artmakers Inc. is a community mural organization that develops and creates politically-oriented public art relevant to the lives and concerns of the neighborhoods in which the murals are located. Artmakers was established in 1983 and has created over 50 murals nationally and internationally, the majority of which are in New York City. The group is artist-run, and works in collaboration with many community organizations, including block associations, schools, community gardens, homeless shelters, health care facilities, and other artist groups, to develop mural projects. The organization also offers an apprenticeship program for youth to build their artistic abilities and professional skills.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>At the time of accessioning, materials were rehoused in archival boxes and described on the collection-level with a box-level inventory. Born-digital items were identified, physically separated, and inventoried.</p><p>At the time of processing, materials were rehoused in archival folders and legal manuscript boxes. Materials were arranged into two series and inventoried at the file level. Many items were removed from non-archival sleeves and photographs were removed from photo albums. Financial materials (bank statements, receipts, and invoices), duplicate publications and documents, publications available online, and documents with sensitive personal information were removed. Born-digital materials have been forensically imaged, analyzed, and described. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.</p><p>In June 2025, additional materials were found in the vault; they were rehoused in flat file folders and incorporated intellectually into the finding aid.</p><p>In October 2025, oversized materials and rolled items were returned from Preservation, after being rehoused in appropriate sized containers, and intellectually integrated into the inventory. Two posters were cleaned for inactive mold.</p>  </processinfo>

Also included are administrative materials from Cityarts Workshop, mostly from the time before Artmakers was formed and during its early years. Materials include historical documents (e.g., articles of incorporation), general correspondence, grant proposals, financial documents, artists' files (if they participated with the group), permissions, conference submissions and proposals, and lecture notes/other presentation materials (e.g., PowerPoints). Artists' files, mostly of artists who collaborated with Artmakers, include slides, biographies, art reviews, writing, and exhibition postcards, mostly for events not sponsored by Artmakers but related to murals and/or community art. Additionally, there are audiotapes and a videotape of Eva Cockcroft's memorial service, an interview with Jane Weissman about the history of murals in New York City, and flyers and brochures of Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC), a similar organziation to Artmakers, located in Los Angeles, California.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_c655fc7ecad790c9e80b0c666362607c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cityarts Workshop</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/1002832</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1972/1990" type="inclusive">1972-1990</unitdate></did><c id="aspace_d43587476cec50f7d15296539db714ea" level="file"><did><unittitle>Goals, Staff Lists, Press, Artist Guidelines, and Budgets</unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/1002833</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1972/1984" type="inclusive">1972-1984</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
