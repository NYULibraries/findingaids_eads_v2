    <abstract id="aspace_711db08e12e2187f9e79dcc7d66b9899">Founded in 1985, the Guerrilla Girls are a feminist art collective who focus on issues of gender and racial inequity in the art world, specifically the under-representation of women and minorities in museum and gallery exhibitions. Guerrilla Girls BroadBand continues the works of the Guerrilla Girls, with a special focus on web activism. Their archive includes posters, financial and legal documents, correspondence, and printed ephemera that span the existence of the collective and shed light on its transition from upstart activist group to a trio of organizations, each with their own feminist focus.</abstract>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p> In 1985, a group of female artists, incensed by an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art that included 165 artists but only 17 women, founded the Guerrilla Girls. From that point on, using statistics-based, text-centric posters and billboards, the group sought to educate the art world about its own institutionalized discrimination by targeting art institutions and art critics who failed to provide women and minorities representation. The group also staged public interventions while wearing gorilla masks to protect their identities. Anonymity is a key aspect of the group's activism, and members (primarily artists) adopt the names of overlooked artists as pseudonyms.</p><p>In the late nineties, the Guerrilla Girls entered a phase during which some of its founding members split apart from the group.  Disagreements over focus, financial dealings, and the future of the collective's mission led to the formation of three separate groups, all three of which still functioned as of 2013.  Today, the GuerrillaGirlsBroadBand, Inc., Guerrilla Girls On Tour, Inc. (the Theatre Girls), and Guerrilla Girls, Inc. all continue to promote the objectives of the collectives.</p><p>Guerrilla Girls BroadBand was formed in 2001. While continuing the aims of the original Guerrilla Girls, it sees the world wide web as its "natural habitat". From their viewpoint, the "original Unincorporated Collective of Guerrilla Girls had come unstuck partly through a lack of agreed procedures for such things as diversity, power-sharing, and collective rights to intellectual property. The Broads set out to fix these problems and blaze a trail for future collective artistic endeavours."</p><p>Sources:</p><p>Guerrilla Girls BroadBand "about page" (ggbb.org/about)

    <head>Provenance</head>
<p>The collection was donated to NYU's Fales Library and Special Collections by artist and Franklin Furnace founder Martha Wilson in 2010. Additional materials were donated in 2015; the accession number associated with this gift is 2015.274.</p><p>http://www.guerrillagirls.com/ was initially selected by curators and captured through the use of The California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service in 2007 as part of the Other Left Activism Web Archive. In 2015, these websites were migrated to Archive-It.  Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In 2017, crawling was discontinued in the Other Left Activism Web Archive and restarted in the Guerrilla Girls Web Archive. http://guerrillagirlsbroadband.com was initially captured in 2015 in the Guerrilla Girls Web Archive and continued in 2017 in the Guerrilla Girls Broadband Web Archive. In 2019, http://guerrillagirlsontour.com/ was added to the Guerrilla Girls Web Archive. The accession number associated with this seed is 2019.055.  Indidivdual videos were added to better capture the videos embedded in http://www.guerrillagirls.com/. The accession number associated with the videos is 2019.061.

<p>As part of processing, real names of members of the Guerrilla Girls were redacted to protect the anonymity on which the group relies. Redactions were made on photocopy facsimiles. In 2015, an addition was added to the collection, and incorporated into series V.B. (Postcards, Stickers, and Miscellaneous Graphic Works) and V.C. (Dimensional Works and Ephemera) in accordance with previous arrangement decisions, and due to their similar fomats and content.</p><p>In 2019 and 2022-2023, the archived websites were added as Series VIII.</p><p>In January 2025, digital objects for processed electronic records were created to conform to current practices.

These websites contain information on their upcoming lectures, book signings, performances, and workshops. They also contain summaries of performances and books, where their art is being exhibited, biographies of women artists that become the members' pseudonyms, videos of their performances, Guerrilla Girls printable mask, posters, current and past projects, and press. Editions of their newsletter go back to 2001. Topics focused on the website include lack of women and people of color in the film industry and art museums; abortion; hate speech; war; and marriage equality. In 2016, http://www.guerrillagirls.com/ was redesigned. </p><p>The Male Graze was an online art commission by the Guerrilla Girls, Inc. for Art Night 2021, a contemporary art festival in the United Kingdom. The Male Graze explores western art's focus on female bodies, male artists exploitation and abuse of women, rewriting of museum wall labels to reflect these exploitation and abuse, and naked women versus women artists counts at reported museums. The website is broken down into six sections: Flesh Through the Ages, Bad Male Behavior, Art School/Art World Confidential, Helping Museums Write Wall Labels, Are There More Naked Women Than Women Artists in Museums?, and Comments/Apologies.</p><p>Capture of  Guerrilla Girls On Tour, Inc. began in 2019. Guerrilla Girls on Tour is the blog listing their upcoming lectures, book signings, performances, and workshops for the Guerrilla Girls. The website was redesigned in 2020 to include more information on their books, <emph render="italic">UN/MASKED</emph> and <emph render="italic">PUSH/PUSHBACK</emph>. It also included information on virtual tours during the COVID-19 pandemic. The website redesigned again in 2022.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_f53854f0792f9384e50381cbaf1b1f30"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl.
