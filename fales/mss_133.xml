    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Mabou Mines is a collaborative, avant-garde theater company based in New York City. Founded in 1970, the company took its name from an old mining town in northern Nova Scotia, near where founding members JoAnne Akalaitis, Lee Breuer, Philip Glass, Ruth Maleczech, and David Warrilow developed <emph render="italic">The Red Horse Animation</emph>, the group's first original performance piece. Since then, Mabou Mines has produced scores of plays; collaborated with writers, musicians, visual artists, and filmmakers; and performed around the globe.</p>

<p>Lee Breuer and Ruth Maleczech met studying theater at UCLA in the late 1950s. Around 1960, the couple hitchhiked to San Francisco to participate in the city's theater scene. Working at the San Francisco Actor's Workshop and the San Francisco Mime Troupe they met Bill Raymond, and at the San Francisco Tape Music Center they met JoAnne Akalaitis. In 1964, Akalaitis moved to New York City but left for Paris soon after with composer (and future husband) Philip Glass. The following year Breuer and Maleczech left San Francisco for Europe. The two couples met up while traveling in Greece, went back to Paris, and with actor David Warrilow, began to work on staging Samuel Beckett's <emph render="italic">Play</emph>. It premiered at the American Cultural Center in 1967. It was also in Paris that the group first met actor Frederick Neumann. In 1969, back in New York with Glass, Akalaitis wrote the others in Paris suggesting they form a theater group in New York.</p>

<p>Influenced by Jerzy Grotowski's teaching and Beckett's work, Mabou Mines went on to produce experimental theater pieces like Breuer's <emph render="italic">Red Horse Animation</emph>, pieces that resulted from intense collaboration and improvisation, and incorporated elements of visual art, dance, mime, puppetry, and music. <emph render="italic">Arc Welding Piece</emph> (1972), for example, featured an artist using an arc welder to make cuts in a large piece of metal, while actors expressed various states of emotion, their faces enlarged by magnifying lenses. In 1974, Fred Neumann joined the group to work on Breuer's second "Animation," <emph render="italic">The B. Beaver Animation</emph>. Bill Raymond joined shortly thereafter. In its early years, Mabou Mines moved between the art world and the theater, often performing in galleries as well as on stages. But its work with Beckett's writing firmly situated the group within a theatrical context. After an early residency at La Mama Experimental Theatre Club in New York, the company began performing at Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater, and other venues in New York and elsewhere.</p>

<p>From the beginning, creative roles were fluid and collaboration was key, but Lee Breuer served as the company's primary director. In 1975 however, Akalaitis directed <emph render="italic">Cascando</emph> and opened the door for other members to take on new roles, for the company to expand, and for multiple projects to come together simultaneously. Akalaitis went on to direct <emph render="italic">Dressed Like an Egg </emph>(1977) and <emph render="italic">Southern Exposure </emph>(1979), and wrote and directed <emph render="italic">Dead End Kids</emph> (1980); Neumann directed <emph render="italic">Mercier and Camier </emph>(1979); Maleczech directed <emph render="italic">Vanishing Pictures </emph>(1980). Other performers worked with Mabou Mines, including L.B. Dallas, Linda Hartinian, Ellen McElduff, Greg Mehrten, Terry O'Reilly, and B-St. John Schofield.</p>

<p>The company steadily expanded its repertoire and continued its tradition of collaboration, working with performers and artists, such as composers Bob Telson, John Zorn, Pauline Oliveros, and David Byrne. Mabou Mines has adapted works by Shakespeare (<emph render="italic">Lear</emph>, 1990), Franz Xaver Kroetz (<emph render="italic">Through the Leaves</emph>, 1984) and <emph render="italic">Help Wanted</emph>, 1986), Philip K. Dick (<emph render="italic">Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said</emph>, 1985), and Bertolt Brecht (<emph render="italic">In the Jungle of Cities</emph>, 1991). The company has toured in the United States and abroad.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The initial collection of the Mabou Mines Archive (1970-1995) contains materials that document the first 25 years of Mabou Mines, the New York City-based avant-garde theater company. The collection includes materials that document the  methods used by Mabou Mines to create theatrical adaptations from existing texts. Collaboration is a key element of Mabou Mines' artistic vision. All decisions, artistic and administrative, large and small, are made by the company members, and each member functions variously as producer, designer, actor, writer, or director. Additionally, all participate as members of the Board of Directors. Materials in the archive reflect this collaborative environment. The collection contains production materials that document all aspects of theatrical production. It includes administrative records that reflect how the organization sustained, promoted, and financially supported its mission. Also included are scripts, programs, photographic documentation, production books, touring files, design plots, posters, and extensive video documentation of most productions. The collection contains correspondence between Samuel Beckett and Ruth Maleczech and Lee Breuer. Known for Mabou Mines' incorporation of technology in theatrical productions, the Mabou Mines Archive contains extensive film, video, and audio production elements and supporting documentation.</p><p>The various accretions to the Mabou Mines Archive (1924-2014), processed in 2025, consist of physical and digital materials created and collected by Mabou Mines from the company's founding in 1970 through 2014. These materials continue to document the various productions and residency programs created and supported by the company, and the administrative tasks required for operation. Works by Mabou Mines represented in the collection include <emph render='italic'>Belén: A Book of Hours</emph>, <emph render='italic'>Dead End Kids: A History of Nuclear Power</emph>, <emph render='italic'>Ecco Porco</emph>, <emph render='italic'>Mabou Mines Dollhouse</emph>, <emph render='italic'>Red Beads</emph>, and <emph render='italic'>Song for New York: What Women Do While Men Sit Knitting</emph>. Materials consist of production files (schedules, architectural drawings, lighting and sound cues, and theater programs), directors' and managers' binders, audio and video recordings of rehearsals and final productions, press and reviews of productions and the company, sound and negative film reels for <emph render='italic'>Dead End Kids</emph>, scripts, photographs, grant applications and reports, posters, programs and fliers for the residency program, film and theater festival programs, and administrative files, such as correspondence, 122 Community Center (location of the company) Board of Directors' minutes and agendas, and space renovation plans. Earlier shows, from the 1970s-early 1990s, are well represented in the audio and video reels and audiocassette tapes. Productions from the early 2000s are well represented in the born digital materials. All of the materials from these accretions illustrate the mission of Mabou Mines, to support works that are innovative and representative of various experiences and identities.</p><p>The archived website also documents Mabou Mines' current and past productions and their development programs.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>In August 2017, four items were prepared to be moved to offsite art storage in September 2017. Negatives were rehoused in plastic sleeves, and the original labeled sleeve was retained and placed behind the negative. In 2019, 108 posters were located in a trunk and surveyed for preservation needs. Rolled posters were humidified and dried under weight, tears were mended, adhesive residue was reduced, and tape was trimmed. These posters were integrated into the collection as a new series (Series XV) in accordance with the collection's existing arrangement structure. In 2023 45 duplicate VHS were deaccessioned and returned to the donor.</p><p>In October 2023, six flat file folders from Creative Time Records were transferred to this collection. In March 2025, container instances for access copies were updated in the inventory. In May 2025, when processing began on the accretions, box 223 was discovered to be missing. Materials were placed into acid-free legal boxes and folders, and oversized materials were rehoused in appropriately sized boxes. Materials in binders were removed from their enclosures, and some items were removed from non-archival sleeves. Duplicate publications, recordings, and documents, publications widely available online or in NYU's catalog holdings, and documents with sensitive personal information were removed. Film elements, such as outtakes, trims, heads, and tails, and unidentified half inch and one-inch audio reels were removed. Previous Oversize Series III, IV, VIII, X, and XII were intellectually integrated into the current series and subseries. Individual items from the processed portion of the Video Recording and Audio Recording Series were nested underneath the production title or added to the alphabetical list intellectually. Existing, processed files in Series XII, XIII, and XVI were renamed "Chronological Financial Files", "Chronological Management Files", and "Chronological Poster Files" respectively, and intellectually incorporated into the arrangement. A flat file folder of Ontological Hysteric Theater posters were transferred to the Richard Foreman and Kate Manheim Papers. Audiovisual materials from box 164 were rehoused into Shared Fales 123 and box 316; three commercial audiocassettes were removed. After rehousing, there is no box 164.</p><p>249 CDs, DVDs, floppy disks, and zip disks were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit. The file "!1997ART.IST" in FA_MSS_ER_115 contained a virus; the contents of the file were written to a new file 1997.IST.doc. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.</p><p>In 2025, the archived website was also added to the collection.</p>  </processinfo>

This rating system was expressed through the use of color-coded circle stickers attached to the tops of some folders. Rave reviews were given red or orange stickers, yellow stickers were for mixed reviews, and black were for negative reviews. Presumably, this enabled those working at Mabou Mines to quickly determine the general critical opinion of a given performance, and also served as a shortcut to finding reviews from which to pull quotes for press releases, advertisements, etc. This rating system was not retained when the collection was processed at Fales Library for the following reasons: (1) the researcher is better served if several reviews of a performance are collected into a single folder; (2) the rating system was not uniformly applied; (3) some colored stickers had fallen off before the series was processed; (4) a reader can distinguish a rave from a pan.</p></processinfo><c id="aspace_ref1745" level="series"><did><unittitle>Subseries X.A.

John was designed and constructed by Linda Hartinian.</p><p>John's accessories include a navy blue knit beanie hat, a navy blue T-shirt with a boys' summer camp logo, a Kodak camera, a striped corduroy cushion, a beige band with a blue tie closure, and foam knee pads with velcro straps that were likely used by his puppeteer (all stored in box 349).</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref1812" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rose--<emph render="italic">The Shaggy Dog Animation</emph></unittitle><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/3/archival_objects/459250</unitid><origination label="Creator"><persname authfilenumber="(lccn)n92065036" source="naf">Hartinian, Linda</persname></origination><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1978/1978">1978</unitdate><container altrender="Custom Puppet Box" id="aspace_6ebb7855053d7cbe2eea4a16b2a34a77" label="Mixed Materials [31142063104106]" type="Box">341</container><container id="aspace_b5f65dcf2605802419e29f0671a74c5f" parent="aspace_6ebb7855053d7cbe2eea4a16b2a34a77" type="Item">133.2.0021</container><container altrender="OS Box - 13 x 18.5" id="aspace_7b3d29bf82560f043f7e58a7ae1f84dd" label="Mixed Materials [31142063104122]" type="Box">348</container><container altrender="OS Flat Box - 19 " id="aspace_8566e05748892a4bf75bfd14456be65d" label="Mixed Materials [31142063104098]" type="Box">361</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d8d926ccea7c384be3c91db76b5b6178"><head>Scope and Content note</head><p>Rose, a puppet created by Linda Hartinian, measures 44" long, 15" wide, 6" deep, and is stored in box 341. Rose has long, dark brown hair and is dressed in a long-sleeved black jumpsuit with black corduroy shoes.</p><p>Rose's accessories include a painted head with two detachable wigs, a blue turtleneck and jeans, red sneakers and white socks, blue beaded elastic bands, a pink satin heart (all stored in box 348), a fur-lined denim jacket, a taxidermied paw, a gray sweatsuit, a black and metallic-colored kimono, beige satin cushions embroidered with red roses, and a beige satin band with velcro, and clear plastic poles used to control the puppet (all stored in box 361). Rose's costumes were created by Sally Rosen and Dru-ann Chukram.</p><p>Rose's head is double-sided, featuring two distinct faces. The first is painted a pale yellow-beige color with a long, wavy brown wig and the second face, directly on the other side, seemingly depicts an older woman. It has a slightly darker, more pink skin tone and a long, wavy gray wig. A wooden dowel is attached to the bottom of the double-sided head. </p><p>Rose's fur-lined denim jacket is split vertically along the back from the bottom hem to its collar to accommodate Rose's puppeteer. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref1814" level="file"><did><unittitle>Airplane--<emph render="italic">MahabharANTa</emph> shadow puppet</unittitle><unitid
